[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText01]
Welcome to the White Mountains.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText02]
We must rid this pass of goblins.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText03]
To pan around, hold down the right mouse button and move your mouse around.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText04]
You can also use the arrow keys on your keyboard to do this.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText05]
To select the soldiers left click on them with your cursor.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText06]
Move the soldiers into the camp by right clicking on the ground in the spotlight up ahead.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText07]
Spotlights will help guide you through this mission.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText08]
Goblins have been raiding these camps. Lead the soldiers into battle against the goblins.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText09]
Next you'll need to know how to select an army.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText10]
In order to select multiple battalions quickly, click and hold the left mouse button down on empty space and drag your mouse over the units you wish to select.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText11]
Try selecting the battalions in those spotlights by using the selection box method.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText12]
Move those units up to the spotlight ahead by right clicking on the ground with them selected.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText13]
Select your army again using the selection box method.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText14]
Now issue them an attack command by right clicking on the Goblins. The red attack cursor will indicate which units are enemy to you.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText15]
Issue your attack order by selecting your units and right clicking on the enemy goblins.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText16]
Other camps are being attacked and need support.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText17]
The Palantir is that object located at the bottom left of your screen. It has a variety of useful buttons and information such as the mini-map.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText18]
The Mini-Map is an overhead view of the entire map. Currently the mini-map is being flashed with the two camps you need to help.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText19]
White flashes inform you of objective locations. While a red flash would indicate where your forces are being attacked.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText20]
On the Palantir is the Objectives Menu. Click on the Objective button now to see what your current objective is.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText21]
There are two types of Objectives, Main Objectives and Bonus Objectives. Main Objectives appear in white text and need to be accomplished in order to complete a mission.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText22]
Bonus Objectives appear in green text. You may choose to complete them, but they won't count against you if you don't.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText23]
An Objective with a check mark in its box is an objective you've completed.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText24]
To exit the Objectives Screen, click on the Resume Game button at the bottom.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText25]
Now, move your army to those camps and help eliminate the goblins.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText26]
The other camp is still under attack.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText27]
All the camps are now secure and the road between them is safe.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText28]
We need to set up a larger camp, but we'll need a great deal of land with which to do so.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText29]
Up ahead is such an expanse of land, but it is held by Spider Lairs.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText30]
Destroy those lairs and we should be able to establish a new camp here.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText31]
When a lair is destroyed, it will leave behind rubble. You will also need to destroy the rubble or else the lair will rebuild itself.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText32]
You may have noticed that after you destroyed the lairs, they left some treasure behind for you to collect.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText33]
To capture this outpost, select a battalion and right click on the flag next to the outpost.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText34]
While the building is being captured its current flag will lower and our flag will rise in its place.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText35]
The outpost will now provide further resources for our army.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText36]
We sent a builder your way to construct our new camp.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText37]
Select a Builder by left clicking on it.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText38]
You'll notice that a menu appears on the right hand side of the screen. This menu contains all the buildings that are currently available to build.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText39]
We'll need a fortress. To build a fortress left click on the fortress button which is flashing now.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText40]
In order to place down a building, left click anywhere on the land. For the purposes of this camp, place your fortress on the spotlight.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText41]
Fortresses can produce more builders should the need arise. Fortresses can also build Heroes, such as our Lord Boromir.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText42]
They also have upgrades available to them, but we'll get to that another time.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText43]
Now that we have a fortress built, we'll need an economy to fund our base.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText44]
Select a builder and have it build a farm on the spotlight in the upper left. You'll notice that as you're placing the farm it has a percentage attached to it. This percentage will tell you how productive it will be given its current placement on land.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText45]
Mountains, oceans, rivers, or other impassable areas will take away from the productivity of a farm. The resources our farms produce can be tracked by the number at the bottom left of the Palantir.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText46]
Farms contribute to your army's command point limit. So the more farms you build, the more battalions you can command.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText47]
Command Points are tracked by the number at the bottom right of the Palantir.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText48]
Select the builder again and build a barracks on the next spotlight.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText49]
The barracks will be able to produce soldiers and tower guard.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText50]
Build an archery range on the other spotlight.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText51]
The archery range will be able to produce archers and Ithilien rangers.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText52]
Now our base will need fortifications.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText53]
In order to fortify our base, we'll need to set up wall spans. Wall spans begin with wall hubs, which can be built from either our fortress or from our builders.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText54]
In order to build them from the fortress, click on the build plot highlighted.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText55]
Click on the wall hub button to begin building it now.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText56]
Select the wall hub to bring up a build wall button.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText57]
Click that button and move your cursor to the spotlight to the right. As you move your mouse you'll see a see-through wall. This is how your wall will look when you've finished building it.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText58]
To build it, left click on the ground at the spotlight.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText59]
Click on the wall hub you just built in the spotlight and build another wall off to the south. Another spotlight is set up showing you where your wall should end.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText60]
Select the next build plot highlighted on the fortress and build a wall span to the spotlight to the right. Then build to the next spotlight in the north.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText61]
Next we will need to build wall defenses.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText62]
You may upgrade a wall with structures such as arrow towers, trebuchets, gates or wall hubs.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText63]
What we really need right now are the trebuchets. Select any wall segment and build a trebuchet upgrade on it.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText64]
Build 2 battalions of Gondor soldiers from the barracks.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText65]
Now build two battalions of Gondor archers from the archery range.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText66]
We'll need a Hero to lead our troops. Heroes can be purchased from the fortress. If your Heroes should fall in battle, they can be revived from the fortress as well.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText67]
To summon a Hero, select your fortress and click on the Heroes button. This will bring up a menu of all the current Heroes you're allowed to build. Right now Boromir is residing in our fortress.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText68]
Click on his portrait to summon him.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText69]
Heroes in general have an array of special powers and abilites that make them unique and vital for a strong army. Select Boromir now.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText70]
You will find a Hero's abilities on the palantir. Some are passive abilities which are always enabled such as Boromir's leadership ability.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText71]
Other powers can be set to autocast by right clicking its button in the palantir. You will see its outline sparkle when this is enabled.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText72]
Right click on Boromir's Horn of Gondor ability to set it to autocast.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText73]
Our army is built and Gondor's new fortress is complete. You've learned all the basics of building and controlling a base and an army.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText74]
SCOUT: The goblins, they're here! A large force has gathered and is moving towards this very spot.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText75]
You will have to defend this base as you've done before with the camps.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText76]
Remember, select your army and right click on the enemy units to issue attack orders. You can select one battalion at a time and issue them attack orders to specific enemy battalions.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText77]
Victory is ours! Great job my lord! That ought to send those Goblins back to their caves.


[SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText78]
Come back when you're ready to finish them off by playing through the Advanced Tutorial.



[SCRIPT:MATutorial_Objective01]

[SCRIPT:MATutorial_Objective02]

[SCRIPT:MATutorial_Objective07]
Use fire to destroy the enemy camp.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_Objective08]
Destroy the goblin base.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText01]
Welcome back to the White Mountains. As you can see we've been very busy here, \n but the goblin attacks have yet to stop.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText02]
The goblins seem to be coming from across the river. I suggest \n we take the fight to their base!


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText03]
Before we move forward, I would like to teach you some \n of the tactics that our battalions have been working on.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText04]
Each battalion can enter a particular attack mode, or what we refer to as stances. These stances can boost their power or defense. Click on the Gondor soldier battalion in the spotlight.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText05]
The stances button is located on the palantir. If you click on it, it will bring up a menu with 3 stances to choose from.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText06]
The Battle Stance is the default stance for all units and renders no bonuses or penalties to a unit's abilities.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText07]
The Aggressive Stance will increase a unit's offensive capabilities while decreasing their defensive capabilities.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText08]
The Hold Ground Stance will greatly increase a unit's defensive capabilities while decreasing their offensive capabilities.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText09]
Set the battalion you have selected into its Aggressive Stance by clicking on the Aggressive Stance button.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText10]
Now let's have our army form up into a battle line.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText11]
Select multiple battalions and move your cursor over to the spotlight.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText12]
Now press and hold both the right and left mouse buttons and drag your mouse. You'll notice that a formation preview will display on the ground. Once you release the mouse buttons, your units will form up into this battle line.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText13]
We must take our army across the river and over to the enemy's base. In order to do so we will need a shipwright.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText14]
There's a shipwright to the East of here along the river.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText15]
Move a battalion to the shipwright and capture it. Remember to capture it by right clicking on the flag while having a battalion selected.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText16]
Selecting the shipwright will bring up options of different types of vessels you may purchase.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText17]
The transport will ferry your troops across large bodies of water.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText18]
Battleships will help destroy enemy ships that impede your way.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText19]
Gondor has sent naval reinforcments. Let's join up with them. Select the shipwright and click on the Transport to begin building one.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText20]
Now select your battalion and right click on the Transport. You'll notice that your cursor changes to a garrison icon. Other structures in Middle-earth can be garrisoned as well, so keep an eye out for that icon.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText21]
Great, now move your transport into the spotlight to join up with the rest of the Gondor convoy.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText22]
GONDOR OFFICER: A fell beast! Watch out!


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText23]
GONDOR OFFICER: It destroyed one of the Transports! Hurry, get to the beach quickly!


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText24]
GONDOR OFFICER: Engage those Corsair ships! Send them to the bottom of the river!


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText25]
In order to deploy your units from a Transport, select the Transport and give it a move order on land.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText26]
There's one of their camps up ahead. Issue an Attack-move order and that should take care of them.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText27]
To issue an Attack-move order, select your army and press the A key on your keyboard. This will change your cursor to an Attack-move cursor.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText28]
Then, right click on the ground in the spotlight behind the camp. This will send your army on a path of destruction to that point, killing every enemy they encounter.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText29]
It appears as though the goblins have retreated over that wall. Unfortunately goblins are able to scale walls by climbing them whereas we are not, nor do we have any siege weapons to take down those walls.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText30]
We'll have to call in for greater powers to help us progress.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText31]
At your disposal is a list of powers that can be purchased from the Evenstar icon located on the palantir. Click on the Evenstar icon now.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText32]
As you can see, all the powers are tiered, which means you have to purchase the lower costing powers in order to access the more expensive powers.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText33]
In order to purchase a power, you must have an amount of power points equal to or greater than the number associated with that power.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText34]
Go ahead and purchase the Arrow Volley and Earthquake powers. They are currently the only powers available to buy.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText35]
To exit, click the Accept button at the bottom of the screen.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText36]
Every time you buy a new power, it will appear on the left hand side of your screen just above the palantir.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText37]
Now back to the battle. Left click on the Arrow Volley power and move your cursor over the goblins.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText38]
To use the power, left click on the ground.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText38b]
To use the power, left click on the ground.

[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText39]
Keep in mind that certain powers such as Arrow Volley can only be cast in areas that are visible to you.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText40]
Now to get past these walls. Unfortunately the gate is in disrepair and cannot be opened, so we'll have to destroy these walls.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText41]
The Earthquake power will deal a significant amount of damage to these walls and should be enough to clear our path.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText42]
Left click on the Earthquake power now and left click underneath those walls to cast it.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText43]
Continue north along the path and be wary of any camps you encounter.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText44]
ITHILIEN RANGER: M'lord, we are glad you have come. We've been keeping an eye on this Goblin camp and have set up a trap for them. All we need to do is set the forest ablaze around them and it should spread into their camp.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText45]
Fire has become a valuable asset as of late. Unfortunately in our enemy's hands it could be a serious danger.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText46]
Select the rangers who have joined you and have them volley their arrows into the spotlights. This will start a fire there and you'll be able to watch it spread into the enemy's base.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText47]
That was the last of their camps, their main base is just to the west.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText48]
There's their main base. It appears as though those tunnels are how they've been traveling through these mountains.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText49]
One thing to note about their tunnels is that when destroyed, you must also destroy the rubble they leave behind. Otherwise the tunnels will spring forth once more and the Goblins will be able to use them yet again.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText50]
If we completely destroy their tunnels and their fortress, that should put a stop to them infesting these mountains once and for all.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText51]
Their fortress is killing our army. Use your Earthquake power again on their fortress and it should take down their defenses.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText52]
Victory is ours! The goblin threat has been eliminated once and for all in this mountain pass. Minas Tirith will be pleased to hear of our victory and may sleep safely knowing this pass is once again controlled by Gondor.


[SCRIPT:MATutorial_MissionText53]
And you, milord, are now ready to vanquish more evil from Middle-earth. Take with you all that you have learned and try a campaign, a skirmish versus the AI, or a multiplayer match online against your friends!

[SCRIPT:LAIntro01]
In the year 3429 of the Second Age, the Dark Lord Sauron took the fortress-city of \n Minas Ithil and burned its White Tree.


[SCRIPT:LAIntro02]
Soon his forces spread from Mordor and began assailing the Free Peoples of Middle-earth.


[SCRIPT:LAIntro03]
In response, Elendil, King of the Dúnedain and Gil-galad, High King of the Noldor, forged a great alliance.


[SCRIPT:LAIntro04]
Together, Elves and Men sought to bring about Sauron's ultimate destruction.


[SCRIPT:LAIntro05]
Their great host marched upon Mordor, where they laid siege to Barad-dur for seven years.


[SCRIPT:LAIntro06]
In time, Sauron and his forces were forced to retreat to Mount Doom, whose rugged terrain \n was easy to defend and difficult to traverse.


[SCRIPT:LAIntro07]
Wishing a swift end to the war, Elendil commanded his son Isildur to take a small force \n and enter Sauron's last hold to break its defense and allow the army through.


[SCRIPT:LAElrond01]
This pass is heavily guarded. We must take care not to rouse the full might of Sauron's garrison or we will be undone.


[SCRIPT:LAElrond02]
This orc camp lies in a place of great strategic value.


[SCRIPT:LAElrond03]
There it lies, the last garrison defending Orodruin's treacherous slopes. Let us gather our forces and strike hard, so that Elendil and Gil-galad may march their armies forward.


[SCRIPT:LAIsildur01]
Yet we must make haste. Let us press on and put a torch to these towers, so that we may shroud our advance.


[SCRIPT:LAIsildur02]
Let us claim it and establish a camp!

Tutorial Complete


[WOTRTutorial:TutorialCompletedText]
Congratulations! You have successfully completed the War of the Ring tutorial.


[WOTRTutorial:LW_InstructionText01]
Welcome To the War Of The Ring.


[WOTRTutorial:LW_InstructionText02]
The War Of The Ring is a turn-based strategic game that is played on the living world map.


[WOTRTutorial:LW_InstructionText03]
Territories that are under your control will be highlighted with your color and territories claimed by your enemies will be highlighted with their respective colors.


[WOTRTutorial:LW_InstructionText04]
To zoom in and out of the map, push the mouse wheel forward and backward. To scroll through the map, push your cursor towards the edge of the screen to move in that direction.


[WOTRTutorial:LW_InstructionText05]
A single turn is divided into 3 phases, Tactical, Battle, and Retreat.


[WOTRTutorial:LW_InstructionText06]
In the Tactical Phase, you will make all your strategic choices regarding the expansion of your kingdom. Structure Construction, Unit Training, and Army Movement are all decided in this phase.


[WOTRTutorial:LW_InstructionText07]
You can construct new buildings on any open build plot in a territory you control.


[WOTRTutorial:LW_InstructionText08]
There are four basic structure classes to choose from, Fortress, Barracks, Armory, and Farm.


[WOTRTutorial:LW_InstructionText09]
To build a new structure, left click on a build plot to bring up the menu that shows all the available buildings that can be constructed. Then left click on the building you want to construct.


[WOTRTutorial:LW_InstructionText10]
All structures cost a number of turns to build and only one structure per territory can be under construction at a time.


[WOTRTutorial:LW_InstructionText11]
In the Battle Phase, all conflicts between opposing players are fought. A battle occurs when at least one of your armies and one of your enemys armies end up in the same territory after the planned moves are executed from the tactical phase.


[WOTRTutorial:LW_InstructionText12]
In the Retreat phase, all Hero armies that are defeated in battle must withdraw to safe territories.


[WOTRTutorial:LW_InstructionText13]
Command points represent the number of troops you are allowed to train. You can not build more troops than you have command points. Your world command point limit indicates the current population of your empire that inhabits the whole of Middle-earth.


[WOTRTutorial:LW_InstructionText14]
You can train new units at any one of your barracks.


[WOTRTutorial:LW_InstructionText15]
There are four basic unit classes to choose from, Soldier, Archer, Pikeman, and Cavalry.


[WOTRTutorial:LW_InstructionText16]
To train a new battalion, left click on a barracks to bring up the menu that shows all the available units that can be trained. Then left click on the unit you want to train.


[WOTRTutorial:LW_InstructionText17]
All battalions cost a number of turns to train and only one set of troops per barracks can be in training at a time.


[WOTRTutorial:LW_InstructionText18]
All armies are allowed to move to only 1 adjacent territory from their current location per turn. However, the choice of an armys destination depends on the type of army that is being moved.


[WOTRTutorial:LW_InstructionText19]
There are 2 types of armies under your command, Garrison Armies, and Hero Armies.


[WOTRTutorial:LW_InstructionText20]
A garrison army is composed of all the troop battalions that reside in a territory.


[WOTRTutorial:LW_InstructionText21]
To examine the composition of an army, left click to select an army. Then left click on the Selection Details button on the Palantir at the lower left of the screen.


[WOTRTutorial:LW_InstructionText22]
Garrison armies are used to defend the lands of your empire and can only move between territories that you control.


[WOTRTutorial:LW_InstructionText23]
To order a garrison army to join a Hero army, left click to select a garrison army. Then right click on the desired Hero army to have the battalions of your selected army merge with the Hero forces.


[WOTRTutorial:LW_InstructionText24]
A Hero army is a group of battalions that are commanded by a special Hero that has the ability to lead troops into battle.


[WOTRTutorial:LW_InstructionText25]
To order a Hero army to move into a territory, left click to select a Hero army. Then right click on the desired territory to send your selected Hero army to that location.


[WOTRTutorial:LW_InstructionText26]
Active battles are indicated by an animated battle marker. To settle the encounter, left click the battle marker.


[WOTRTutorial:LW_InstructionText27]
This battle screen shows you detailed information about your forces and the enemy forces involved in skirmish in the contested territory.


[WOTRTutorial:LW_InstructionText28]
You may have up to 3 methods for handling an encounter, Auto-Resolve, Realtime, or Retreat.


[WOTRTutorial:LW_InstructionText29]
Only the Hero army leaders survive from a lost battle and have the ability to retreat.


[WOTRTutorial:LW_InstructionText30]
To order a Hero army to retreat, left click to select a defeated Hero army. Then right click on a friendly territory to send your army to that location.


[WOTRTutorial:LW_InstructionText31]
Good Luck!



[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial003subtitle]
The War Of The Ring is a turn-based strategic game of territory conquest, resource management, and epic confrontations that takes place over the lands of Middle-earth.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial004subtitle]
The game is played on the living world map.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial010subtitle]
The game is played as a series of turns that are taken simultaneously by all players.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial013subtitle]
Each phase must be completed by all players before the game continues to the next phase. When all phases have been completed, the turn is over and a new turn begins.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial018subtitle]
First, you will focus on structure construction in the tactical phase of this turn.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial021subtitle]
There are four basic structure classes to choose from, Fortress, Barracks, Armory, and Farm. Each structure class provides a necessary function to a growing empire.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial024subtitle]
Select the open build plot in Cair Andros and build a barracks.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial027subtitle]
Once all players have completed the tactical phase, the strategic choices of each player are revealed on the living world map, and the game continues to the next phase.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial028subtitle]
Since you are not going to construct any more buildings at this time, press the End Phase button to finish the tactical phase.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial032subtitle]
Since there are not any conflicts at this time, the game will continue to the next phase.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial034subtitle]
In the Retreat phase, all armies lead by Heroes that are defeated in battle must withdraw to safe territories.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial035subtitle]
Since you do not have any defeated Hero armies at this time, the game will continue to the next phase.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial036subtitle]
Now that all phases have been finished, a single turn in War Of The Ring is completed. A new turn begins and you start again at the tactical phase.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial039subtitle]
The barracks you started to build in the previous turn has been completed and its abilities are now available for you to use.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial040subtitle]
Next, you will concentrate on unit training in the tactical phase of this turn.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial042subtitle]
Command points represent the number of troops you are allowed to train. You can not build more troops than you have command points.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial043subtitle]
Your world command point limit indicates the current population of your empire that inhabits the whole of Middle-earth. It is displayed at the top left corner of the screen.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial046subtitle]
There are four basic unit classes to choose from, Soldier, Archer, Pikeman, and Cavalry. Each unit class has their own distinct traits and capabilities when fighting the other unit classes.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial048subtitle]
Select the barracks in Cair Andros and train a battalion of troops.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial051subtitle]
Since you are not going to train any more units at this time, press the End Phase button to finish the tactical phase.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial052subtitle]
Again, no conflicts have occurred, so the game will pass through the battle and retreat phases.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial056subtitle]
The battalion you started to train in the previous turn has been completed and is now available for you to command into battle.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial057subtitle]
Finally, you will learn army movement in the tactical phase of this turn.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial063subtitle]
Select the garrison army in Cair Andros and examine its composition by displaying the details panel.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial064subtitle]
Observe that the battalion you just trained appears here.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial065subtitle]
From this panel, detailed stats for each battalion in an army can be seen, and commands to the individual battalions themselves can be given.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial066subtitle]
Garrison armies are used to defend the lands of your empire and can only move between territories that you control. Thus, they cannot takeover neutral territories or invade enemy territories on their own. However, a garrison army can join with a Hero army to strengthen a Hero army's attacking forces.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial069subtitle]
Order the garrison army in Cair Andros to join Aragorn's army in Rohan.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial071subtitle]
A Hero army is a group of battalions that are commanded by a special Hero that has the ability to lead troops into battle. They can not only move between territories that you control, but are also used to expand the lands of your kingdom by conquering neutral territories and invading enemy territories.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial075subtitle]
Select Aragorn's army in Rohan and move into The Dead Marshes.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial077subtitle]
Since you are not going to move any more armies at this time, press the End Phase button to finish the tactical phase.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial079subtitle]
This time during the battle phase there are encounters with the enemy that must be resolved.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial082subtitle]
Select the battle marker in Osgiliath to resolve the conflict.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial083subtitle]
This battle screen shows you detailed information about your forces and the enemy forces involved in the skirmish in the contested territory.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial085subtitle]
Selecting Auto-Resolve will calculate the winner of the battle automatically based on factors such as the size, unit composition, and experience of the forces involved.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial086subtitle]
Selecting Realtime will allow you to manually fight the battle in the disputed territory.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial087subtitle]
Selecting Retreat will allow you to withdraw your forces from the conflict before the battle starts. However, your retreating armies may lose some units in the process.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial088subtitle]
When the battle has been resolved, ownership of the territory will be awarded to the winner.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial089subtitle]
For the purposes of the tutorial, all battles will be auto-resolved.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial090subtitle]
Press the Auto-Resolve button to fight the battle in Osgiliath.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial091subtitle]
You lost this battle, but not the war. Don't give up.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial092subtitle]
During the Battle phase there may be multiple conflicts. Each conflict is resolved one at a time.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial093subtitle]
Select the battle marker in The Dead Marshes to resolve the conflict.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial095subtitle]
Once all battles have been resolved, the battle phase is over.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial096subtitle]
Press the End Phase button to finish the battle phase.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial098subtitle]
Since one of your Hero armies has been defeated in battle, you must withdraw that army to a friendly territory to recover. Only the Hero army leaders survive from a lost battle and have the ability to retreat.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial100subtitle]
Select Boromir's army in Osgiliath and retreat to one of your territories.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial102subtitle]
Once all retreat orders have been issued, the retreat phase is over.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial103subtitle]
Press the End Phase button to finish the retreat phase.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial104subtitle]
The turn is over, but the battle for Middle-earth has just begun.


[WOTRSCRIPT:WOTR_Tutorial105subtitle]
This concludes the War Of The Ring tutorial. Follow these simple guidelines and you will soon dominate the whole of Middle-earth.

*In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mt. Doom... DO NOT TRANSLATE ME! NOT USED.



[DIALOGEVENT:MGWorld_Openingsubtitle]
*DON'T TRANSLATE! SAMPLE TEXT ONLY. In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mt. Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged a powerful ring. And into this ring, he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life. One Ring to rule them all. He used this ring to conquer Middle-earth and enslave its people. But through the encompassing darkness, there was still hope that Heroes would arise to challenge Sauron.

Use this screen to evaluate peer-to-peer connections between players. A player that is unable to connect to other players will either have 'Failed Connection' or will be taking a long time in 'Attempting Connection'. If the connection does not fix, please use the Messenger to advise the player to adjust firewall or port settings. If the problem cannot be addressed, you may want to kick the player out of the session. 'Waiting to Connect' is not bad, it just means that another connection has not been resolved. Players with a poor ping indicator can also adversely affect game play.

*We rescued a messenger who told us of the dragon. We've come to help!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_Gloi002subtitle]
*We've come to help you fight the dragon!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_OffD003subtitle]
*and you bring elves? WellI suppose we'll need whatever help we can afford. This isn't for the faint of heart you know.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_OffD004subtitle]
*erand you bring elves? This is a \"Dwarven mine\". No place for wood folk.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_OffD005subtitle]
* ..well...we trust your judgement. Just keep an eye on them.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_OffD006subtitle]
*If they are here to collect riches, they should come no further.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_OffD007subtitle]
*Enough of the chatter! Let's slay the dragon and reclaim what is ours!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_Gloi003subtitle]
*It may be safer to build inside.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_Gloi004subtitle]
*We'll need to build a forge.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_OffD008subtitle]
*They must have barricaded the door. We'll have to break it down!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_OffD009subtitle]
*The Demolisher can get through it.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_OffD010subtitle]
*This fine door was meant to keep enemies out!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_OffD011subtitle]
*We'll have to break it down.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_OffD012subtitle]
*Watch out. It's a swarm of Cave Bats!!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_Gloi005subtitle]
*Spiders? Who let THEM in here! Argh. Destroy their nests!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_Dwar001subtitle]
*Over there! Goblins!...Where are they going?


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_OffD013subtitle]
*We should build Mine Shafts so we can get to the battles quicker!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_Glor001subtitle]
*Be vigilant. There must be more goblins ahead.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_Gloi006subtitle]
*I know that sound. It's the dragon!! He must have awakened.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_Dwar002subtitle]
*Our buildings at the entrance are under attack!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_Dwar003subtitle]
*Its the dragon! He's attacking our structures out here!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_Dwar004subtitle]
*The Dragon's back! He's destroying everything!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_Dwar005subtitle]
*It's no use! We can't kill him out here! We'll have to catch him at his lair.... Inside!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_OffD014subtitle]
*The entrance is no longer safe. We must build our structures within the tunnel.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_OffD015subtitle]
*We'll need more resources use Dwarven Riches!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_OffD016subtitle]
*Our troops may need a good morale boost. Use the Rallying Call!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_Dwar006subtitle]
*Mountain Trolls! Regroup!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_Dwar007subtitle]
*Take Cover, Here comes the Dragon again!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_Dwar008subtitle]
*Look Out! Giants!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_Gloi007subtitle]
*Ah the ancient halls of my ancestors


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_Gloi008subtitle]
*Only the dwarves build chambers such as these!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_Dwar009subtitle]
*These Goblins have defiled our homes. They will pay in blood!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_Dwar010subtitle]
*What is that smell?


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_Glor002subtitle]
*Be wary, these tracks belong to drakes.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_Gloi009subtitle]
*Hah! The fire only makes it easier to see them! Attack!!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_Glor003subtitle]
*This place is pretty old. We should be wary of falling stonework.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_Gloi010subtitle]
*Not to worry. This is Dwarven-stonework. There will be no collapsing HERE!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_Dwar011subtitle]
*They're climbing over the walls!!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_Gloi011subtitle]
*Put an end to this infestation!!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_Dwar012subtitle]
*I think that's all of them!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_Glor004subtitle]
*I heard something.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_Glor005subtitle]
*What was that?


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_Gloi012subtitle]
*Its the Dragon! Everyone attack!!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_Glor006subtitle]
*It's end draws near!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE001subtitle]
*Glorfindel! We heard that you may be coming.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE002subtitle]
*Corsairs from the South have sunk our ships and have ransacked the port!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE003subtitle]
*And now their ships linger in the gulf, sinking any ships that attempt to flee!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_Gloi001subtitle]
*Ack! Dwarves, go back to the caves and tell our brothers the enemy is HERE! Surely they will listen!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_Dwar001subtitle]
*Let's go!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_Dwar002subtitle]
*Back to the Blue Mountains!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE004subtitle]
*Corsair ships approach from the south! Ready the fleet!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_Glor001subtitle]
*We must capture the docks and fight off the blockade with our own fleet!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE005subtitle]
*The first transport is away!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE006subtitle]
*The blockade is broken! Escort our ships to safety!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE007subtitle]
*Enemy ships on the horizon. Send them to the bottom!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_Elf1001subtitle]
*More Corsair ships approach!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE008subtitle]
*More Corsairs are approaching! Ready the defenses!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_Glor002subtitle]
*They wait for us out at sea and mock us! Should we go to them?


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_Gloi002subtitle]
*Its a traaap!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_Glor003subtitle]
*They're invading the shores now!! We may be stretched too thin!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_Glor004subtitle]
*We have no defenses there!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_Gloi003subtitle]
*The gulls will feast upon pirate flesh tonight!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffD001subtitle]
*Ay! We couldnt let our friends have ALL the fun now!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffD002subtitle]
*The heart of the Dwarf is a restless one! When the battle calls, we answer!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_Elf1002subtitle]
*It's the Dwarves! They've come to help us!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_Elf1003subtitle]
*The Dwarves! The Dwarves have come!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_Gloi004subtitle]
*Dwarves, Ready yourselves! We must hold the shore at all costs!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_Dwar003subtitle]
*Hold your ground! We must not falter!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_Dwar004subtitle]
*Push them back into the sea! 


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_Dwar001subtitle]
*The town is on fire!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_Dain001subtitle]
*Yes, it seems that we have arrived not a moment too soon! TO ARMS!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_Dain002subtitle]
*Dwarves! We must defend this town with all our strength. The elves may not arrive in time!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_Meno001subtitle]
*King Dáin! You're a welcome sight, friend!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_Meno002subtitle]
*Dwarven friends! Just in time! The armies of Mordor will overrun us soon!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_Dwar002subtitle]
*King Dáin! You've made it!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_Dwar003subtitle]
*King Dáin! You've made it! We've already set up a small base.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_Dwar004subtitle]
*At last, our King arrives!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_Dwar005subtitle]
*Sire, do you think the elves will come and help?


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_Dain003subtitle]
*No time for such worries... To battle!!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_Dwar006subtitle]
*Curse them! They've destroyed our ships!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_Dwar007subtitle]
*It's a troll!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_OffD001subtitle]
*Let us take this area and prepare a counter attack!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_OffD002subtitle]
*There is a dock to the South. We should capture it and take the fight to them!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_Dwar008subtitle]
*Mûmakil!! There are too many!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_Dwar009subtitle]
*Hold steady, Dwarves. These giant beasts cannot last forever!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_OffD003subtitle]
*The catapults! They fire in waves.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_OffD004subtitle]
*Use this wreckage for shelter, then advance when it's clear!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_Dwar010subtitle]
*So much water! We weren't made for this kind of thing.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_Dwar011subtitle]
*Ack! Enough of the water already!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_Dwar012subtitle]
*This is why we dwarves build our homes in solid earth!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_Dwar013subtitle]
*Ye gods! What in Dáin's name is that thing?!!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_Dwar014subtitle]
*Ah, good solid ground at last!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_OffD005subtitle]
*We MUST destroy those Catapults.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_OffD006subtitle]
*We have them! Let's put our axes to work now... Yaahh!!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_Dain004subtitle]
*These people are safe for now.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_Dwar015subtitle]
*Weve set up a base here. Not much, but itll have to do.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_Dwar016subtitle]
*I dont trust these waters...


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_Dwar017subtitle]
*I think I saw something in the water.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_Dwar018subtitle]
*Ah! A Nazgûl!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_Dwar019subtitle]
*There's a mineshaft over here!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_Dwar020subtitle]
*We have a mineshaft ready over here!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_Dwar021subtitle]
*This mineshaft is in working order!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD001subtitle]
*Dale is the only thing left between the enemy and Mount Erebor. We must defend it.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD002subtitle]
*We've set up a fortress in Dale to defend the city.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD003subtitle]
*Dale has fallen!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD004subtitle]
*Fall back to the Gate!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD005subtitle]
*Retreat to the mountain!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD006subtitle]
*This fortress should hold them for a while.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_Dwar001subtitle]
*I've heard that they come out during times of darkness.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_Dwar002subtitle]
*They're inside the mountain!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_Mout001subtitle]
*Now my dear Kingyou will die!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_Dwar003subtitle]
*It's a traaaap!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_Dwar004subtitle]
*The elves! The elves have come!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_Dwar005subtitle]
*Its the Elves!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_Thra001subtitle]
*We come to aid you in this fight!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_Thra002subtitle]
*It seems you are in need of aid, friend dwarf!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_Thra003subtitle]
*Elves! Send these creatures back to the abyss!!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD007subtitle]
*We've lost Dale!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_Dain001subtitle]
*The gate MUST NOT FALL!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_Dain002subtitle]
*We must hold the gate!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_Dain003subtitle]
*Flank from the Tunnels!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD008subtitle]
*Use the tunnels to get to their base!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_Dwar006subtitle]
*Let the river flow red with the blood of the easterlings!!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD009subtitle]
*Use the Earthquake! It will rip their buildings down!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD010subtitle]
*Use the Undermine to get behind their lines!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD011subtitle]
*The Demolisher, can take those buildings down.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_Dain004subtitle]
*Dwarves! This our last chance! Defend Erebor or die!!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_Dwar007subtitle]
*We did it! We killed the hideous Mouth of Sauron!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD012subtitle]
*We will be safe only when ALL of Sauron's forces are destroyed.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_Elro001subtitle]
*Elves of the Golden Wood - hear me! We must cast out the Shadow in the Forest! Our Allies from Mirkwood and Erebor will heed our signal! Galadhrim, to battle!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_Elf1001subtitle]
*Ah! It's horrible!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_Elf2001subtitle]
*I won't go near it!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_OffE001subtitle]
*Our forces flee before the fortress! What dark trickery is THIS?


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_Elro002subtitle]
*It is a cruel image of Sauron. It fills their hearts with dread! Today we will crush this evil!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_OffE002subtitle]
*The statue! That's what's causing them to flee - we must destroy it!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_Elro003subtitle]
*It's the likeness of Sauron. It's enchanted with the dark power of Mordor...Destroy it!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_OffE003subtitle]
*It's the likeness of Sauron. It's enchanted with the dark power of Mordor... Destroy it!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_OffE004subtitle]
*There it is! Seize the Signal Fire!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_OffE005subtitle]
*We've done it - The Mirkwood armies will see our signal.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_Elf1002subtitle]
*King Thranduil has arrived with reinforcements!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_Thra001subtitle]
*The Elves of the Northern Wood will not cower from the Darkness! Elves, Ents - follow my lead!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_Thra002subtitle]
*We've defeated their wretched armies at Erebor. Now we will expel them from these lands for ever!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_OffE006subtitle]
*Take the second Signal Fire! The forces from Erebor await our sign!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_OffE007subtitle]
*It is done! The Dwarves of Erebor should be on their way!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_Elf1003subtitle]
*It's King Dáin! He's come to help us!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_Dain001subtitle]
*The Dwarves of the Mountain stand with you on this day! Dwarf and Elf, let us stand united against the Shadow!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_Glor001subtitle]
*The Black Riders have returned - and they lead a great host of Mordor against us!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_OffE008subtitle]
*What? An army of Mordor has emerged from the forest!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_Elro004subtitle]
*We must not stand firm! It is in fear that our enemy seeks to divide us! Elves, Dwarves, and Men, slay the Enemy to the last!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_Elro005subtitle]
*It is done! The great darkness has been purged from these woods! May the valor shown this day endure in song for all the days to follow.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_OffE009subtitle]
*The Nazgûl leader must be dealt with!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_OffE010subtitle]
*We must face the Nazgûl leader who commands these armies!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Mout001subtitle]
*The raid upon Lorien has long been in the waiting.


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Mout002subtitle]
*The Elves long have tricked and cursed our forces in these parts. Today, that will end.


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG001subtitle]
*We must build an army before we raid the Elven city.


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG002subtitle]
*We're ready. Destroy everything pretty!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG003subtitle]
*Destroy every elf and treehouse in this accursed place!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Mout003subtitle]
*They have a Giant held captive. Free it and it will help us destroy the Elves!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Mout004subtitle]
*Another Giant! Our army will grow yet stronger!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Mout005subtitle]
*Who is that elf?! Such courage must be quelled. Kill him!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Mout006subtitle]
*That elf leader mocks us! Slay him now!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Mout007subtitle]
*Their leader Celeborn, must die!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Mout008subtitle]
*Raze the city to the ground!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG004subtitle]
*It's an ambush! The elves are attacking from the trees!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG005subtitle]
*We can use these mine shafts to move our army through Lorien quickly.


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG006subtitle]
*Destroy the elven treehouses!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Gobl001subtitle]
*Die, you pretty elves! DIE!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Gobl002subtitle]
*Aim for their heads!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Gobl003subtitle]
*This place reeks of elves! We must be close.


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Hald001subtitle]
*Your filth will not spread through this land! Leave now or die!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Hald002subtitle]
*Send them back to their underworld!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Hald003subtitle]
*Leave this place, lest it become your grave!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Hald004subtitle]
*I will die before you set foot upon this sanctuary!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Hald005subtitle]
*Elves! To Arms! The Enemy is here!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Hald006subtitle]
*Away!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Elf1001subtitle]
*Do not let them free the Giant!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Elf2001subtitle]
*The Giant! They will release it upon us!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Elf1002subtitle]
*It's too late! The Giant has been freed!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Elf1003subtitle]
*Back to the shadows, Goblin scum!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Elf2002subtitle]
*Feel the sting of our arrows!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Cele001subtitle]
*The enemy is at our gates! To the defenses!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Cele002subtitle]
*By the light of the Galadriel, you will all perish!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Elf1004subtitle]
*Celeborn is wounded!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Cele003subtitle]
*Escape Galadriel! Flee and warn the others!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Gala001subtitle]
*You shall see my wrath! Minions of Sauron!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Gala002subtitle]
*We must leave or home. Retreat to the lands north of here!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Gobl004subtitle]
*The elf queen has escaped!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Mout009subtitle]
*No matter. We will deal with her later.


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Elf1005subtitle]
*Celeborn is dead!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Elf1006subtitle]
*They've killed Celeborn!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_Cors001subtitle]
*Capture the docks! We'll need it to build more ships!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_Cors002subtitle]
*That's it! The Dock is ours. Now let's get to the Signal Fire!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_Cors003subtitle]
*The Goblin King has an army in the nearby hills and is waiting for us to give him the signal.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_Cors004subtitle]
*Capture the Signal Fire, and the Goblin King's army will come and join the assault!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_Cors005subtitle]
*Excellent! Our first catch of the day.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_Cors006subtitle]
*The beacon is lit! Our transports gather offshore. Defend them at all costs!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_Cors007subtitle]
*The armada is assembled, prepare for the assult!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_Cors008subtitle]
*Our army is now ashore. They can't stop us now!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_Elf1001subtitle]
*No! It cannot be! Black ships from the South!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_Elf2001subtitle]
*The enemy is here! It's an invasion!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_GobK001subtitle]
*Goblins attack! Destroy the elves! Burn it all down!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_Cors009subtitle]
*Haha! The scared little elves, scurrying about in panic.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_GobK002subtitle]
*Move into the city! Topple the place!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_GobK003subtitle]
*Feast upon the flesh of elves!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_GobK004subtitle]
*The elves approach!! Attaack!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_Cors010subtitle]
*Sink any ships that try to escape!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_GobK001subtitle]
*Ahh.the Shire. This day has finally come!! Haehaha!!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_Hobb001subtitle]
*Aack!! Who are those ugly people?!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_Hobb002subtitle]
*They've come to raid the Shire!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_Hobb003subtitle]
*Nono no no. Make it go away!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_OffG001subtitle]
*The hobbits cower in fear. Show them their new homes in the pits!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_GobK002subtitle]
*Enslave the pests! Put them into the pits!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_OffG002subtitle]
*You heard the king! Chase the runts into the pits!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_Dune001subtitle]
*Goblins! Just as we expected! To arms, men!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_Dune002subtitle]
*Goblins are attacking! Protect the hobbits!!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_GobK003subtitle]
*Dunedain... here? Hmph! They can't save these little scrubs!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_Hobb004subtitle]
*We must defend Buckland!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_OffG003subtitle]
*Ah, the builders are here. Let's get that fortress up!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_OffG004subtitle]
*What's this? Farmer Maggot's Mushrooms? Take it for our own!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_OffG005subtitle]
*Ah, the pipeweed farms of Longbottom. This should be worth something. Take it!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_OffG006subtitle]
*Let's take this Farm for ourselves!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_Dune003subtitle]
*Defend the Shire!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_Dune004subtitle]
*Save the hobbits!!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_Dune005subtitle]
*They have breached the camp!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_Dune006subtitle]
*Light the fires! We must light all three!!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_Dune007subtitle]
*Tom will save us!!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_Dune008subtitle]
*The spirit warrior will save us!!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_Dune009subtitle]
*Retreat! Retreat!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_GobK004subtitle]
*At last, the Shire is mine! Haha! That was easy!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_Gobl001subtitle]
*Sire! It's the orcs from Isengard!

[DIALOGEVENT:MEOldFo_Orc012subtitle]
*There's too many of them! 


[DIALOGEVENT:MEOldFo_Orc013subtitle]

*We can't let them build up any more towers!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEOldFo_Orc017subtitle]
*If the Elves build up their last tower, we'll lose the road!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEOldFo_OffM017subtitle]

[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_Mout004subtitle]

[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_OffM004subtitle]
*The Easterlings are with us now. We can build their Palace to hire more of them.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_OffM005subtitle]
*Be on the look out for dragons, they can attack at any time.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_OffM006subtitle]
*Dragons roam freely in this area. Be careful.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_OffM007subtitle]

[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_Orc004subtitle]
*Ah! We've upset a dragon!

[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_Mout010subtitle]
*The Dragon Lord at last! We have come to offer you Dwarven riches


[DIALOGEVENT:MEErebo_Mout001subtitle]
*The people of Dale flee before us. They are wise to trust their senses.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEErebo_Mout002subtitle]
*And where are the dwarves? They hide in their holes under the mountain like frightened rats. 


[DIALOGEVENT:MEErebo_OffM001subtitle]
*Clear out the city of Dale. Seize any resources you might find.

[DIALOGEVENT:MGRiven_OffE050subtitle]
*We should build up our forces before facing the Goblin invaders!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGRiven_OffE051subtitle]
*We will need to build a stronger force before confronting the Goblin camps!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGRiven_OffE052subtitle]

[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_OffD018subtitle]
*The Dragon!! He attacks!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_OffD019subtitle]
*Fire Drakes! They have filled our homes with dread!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_OffD020subtitle]
*Our Fortress must be built inside the cave.only then shall we be safe from the dragon.

[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_Dwar013subtitle]
*We have come to assist you, to help build a fortress.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_Dwar014subtitle]
*Greetings, brethren! No gate shall stand before us.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_Dwar015subtitle]
*Greetings, we come from the South to aid you.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_OffD022subtitle]
*I sense my ancestors here.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_OffD023subtitle]
*This is a bad place.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE009subtitle]
*Elves of Mithlond! Drive the scourge of the Corsairs out of these waters!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE010subtitle]
*The Corsairs pillage and desecrate our homes - drive them out!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE011subtitle]
*The filth of Umbar has been eradicated!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE012subtitle]
*Raise our banner next to the Shipwright!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE013subtitle]
*Raise the banner next to the Shipwright to reclaim it!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE014subtitle]
*We have captured one shipwright. Now, reclaim the other!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE015subtitle]
*Recapture the remaining shipwright!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE016subtitle]
*It is done - both shipwrights are ours to command!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE017subtitle]
*Now, we must rebuild our naval forces, that we may contest the menace of the Corsairs


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE018subtitle]
*We must first construct an attack group of Battleships - they are the backbone of our Navy.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE019subtitle]
*The refuse of Umbar will not relent. We must build more Battleships!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE020subtitle]
*Well done! With these Battleships the Corsairs will surely meet their defeat!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE021subtitle]
*The lore of the Shipwrights of Mithlond is unparalleled, but remember to upgrade the armor and endurance of our naval craft!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE022subtitle]
*The Shipwrights have crafted us an enchanted vessel.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE023subtitle]
*It is the Storm Ship - when it rams into enemy craft, it explodes, creating a swirling vortex of water.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE024subtitle]
*But be wary, for the vortex will sink ally and foe alike!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE025subtitle]
*Construct a Storm Ship from the Shipwright.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE026subtitle]
*It would be wise to build the Storm Ship!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE027subtitle]
*Excellent, the Storm Ship is complete!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE028subtitle]
*The Corsairs wait for us out at sea, mocking us! Let us bring the fight to them!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE029subtitle]
*The Black Ships have blockaded our harbors! Attack them!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE030subtitle]
*Send the Corsair ships to a watery grave!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE031subtitle]
*The blockade is broken!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE032subtitle]
*The Corsairs must be coming from a stronghold in the south. Find it and capture their shipwrights!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE033subtitle]
*Build us Transport ships. With them, we can move our battalions across the waters.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE034subtitle]
*We must capture the Corsair shipwrights, and we cannot do so without the Transports!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE035subtitle]
*Good - now that the Transport is complete, load it up with our Elven battalions!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE036subtitle]
*The transports lie empty. Garrison our units inside them and send them out to take over the Corsair shipwrights!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE037subtitle]
*Once the Transport draws close to shore, select the battalions inside it to unload the Transport.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE038subtitle]
*Our forces will drown helpless should the Corsairs attack! Unload them from the Transports!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE039subtitle]
*Now, capture the shipwrights - we will need them to strengthen our Navy.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE040subtitle]
*The wind carries a fell note across the waters - the heralds of the Armada sound their assault!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE041subtitle]
*The enemy approaches our unprotected shores to the west!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE042subtitle]
*The Corsairs vessels bear siege engines - raining fire upon us!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE043subtitle]
*We must contest this threat. Build Bombardment ships and repel these new craft!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE044subtitle]
*Our vessels burn and sink! Build the Bombardment ships!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffD003subtitle]
*There it is again! A second assault wave approaches!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE045subtitle]
*What! How is this possible! The Corsairs have secretly infiltrated our city!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE046subtitle]
*We are unprotected! Slay the Corsairs before they advance upon our stronghold!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffD004subtitle]
*A third trumpet, and the skies darken, this surely is our final battle!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE047subtitle]
*Unlikely words from you, Master Dwarf! But we will not perish at the hands of this rabble, I swear to you!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE048subtitle]
*We must rally our strength and stand firm against this final attack!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE049subtitle]
*We are victorious! Grace and good fortune both have favored us on this day of battle!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE050subtitle]
*We have failed - Mithlond has fallen to the enemy!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_OffD007subtitle]
*There are Shipwrights to the North and South. We should destroy them!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_OffD008subtitle]
*Mordor must have a Fortress. We should destroy it.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_OffD009subtitle]
*A Nazgûl!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_OffD010subtitle]
*The Nazgûl returns!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_OffD011subtitle]
*Accursed Nazgûl, when will you die!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_OffD012subtitle]
*King Dáin! We shall fight along side you!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_OffD013subtitle]
*All the Catapults are destroyed.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_OffD014subtitle]
*Those fire ships! They are relentless!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD013subtitle]
*We can train more Builders from the Throne of Erebor.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD014subtitle]
*This room houses all of our Dwarven Barracks.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD015subtitle]
*We can train our troops here.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD016subtitle]
*You can build up the heavy equipment in here.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD017subtitle]
*Our Forgeworks are located here.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD018subtitle]
*We will need to send troops to Dale.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD019subtitle]
*We must set up a defense out here to buy some time for our defenses inside the mountain.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD020subtitle]
*Hold the city of Dale while we build up our defenses inside the mountain.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD021subtitle]
*They're attacking the Gate!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD022subtitle]
*The gate is heavily damaged!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD023subtitle]
*They've almost broken through!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD024subtitle]
*The Mordor scum defile our Throne!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD025subtitle]
*If the Throne is destroyed all hope is lost!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD026subtitle]
*Hurry, we must build up the defenses of Dale, the Enemy draws near!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD027subtitle]
*The Mordor host draws near. I can smell their foul stench.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD028subtitle]
*Ha! Is that the best they can do!?


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD029subtitle]
*We can use the buildings inside Erebor to train up more troops.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD030subtitle]
*Dale might be lost, but we still have more resources in the mountain.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD031subtitle]
*The Mordor army approaches... CLOSE THE GATE!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD032subtitle]
*Use the undermine tunnels to retreat back into the Mountain.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD033subtitle]
*Though Dale has fallen, all is not lost! We must defend the Mountain!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD034subtitle]
*Fall back inside the mountain and regroup!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD035subtitle]
*We can revive our fallen heroes at the Throne of Erebor.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_OffE011subtitle]
*Elves, we must capture the signal fires in the North and South. Once taken, our reinforcements will be summoned in turn!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_OffE012subtitle]
*Our reinforcements await the Signal Fire! Capture it!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_OffE013subtitle]
*Take the second Signal Fire! Our forces await our sign!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_OffE014subtitle]
*The enemy hath been defeated. We have reclaimed the forests!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_OffE015subtitle]
*Now, lay siege to the dark fortress and breach the inner perimeter!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_OffE016subtitle]
*We must break through the inner walls of Dol Guldur. To arms!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_OffE017subtitle]
*The outer walls hath been breached!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_OffE018subtitle]
*Destroy every accursed building and abode within!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_OffE019subtitle]
*Nothing must be left standing - destroy every foul pit and den of this wicked place!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_OffE020subtitle]
*The force of the Shadow's will comes from this castle. Destroy this abomination!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_OffE021subtitle]
*Rend the castle to ruins! It is an abomination that must not stand!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_Elf1004subtitle]
*The castle hath fallen!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_OffE022subtitle]
*Many tortured souls perished cruelly in this prison - destroy it so that they can be at peace!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_OffE023subtitle]
*We cannot leave this fell prison intact - cast it down!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_Elf1005subtitle]
*The prison is no more!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_OffE024subtitle]
*There are still buildings left inside the fortress. We must destroy them!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_Elf1006subtitle]
*All buildings within the citadel are in ruins! Dol Guldur is but a hollow shell to topple!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_OffE025subtitle]
*All structures have been eradicated - the dark heart of Dol Guldur has been carved out!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_OffE026subtitle]
*Our hearts must not falter - vanquish the hordes of Mordor!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_OffE027subtitle]
*The hosts of Mordor assail us from the forest! Slay every last one of them!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_Elf1007subtitle]
*We have survived! The Mordor army is no more!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_OffE028subtitle]
*The Shadow has overwhelmed us - retreat!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG007subtitle]

[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG008subtitle]
*We need a goblin cave to create our invasion force - Get moving builder!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG009subtitle]
*Our tunnels will provide resources. With more of them, our riches will grow.


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG010subtitle]
*Build us a second tunnel so that we may conquer this land


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG011subtitle]
*We need a second tunnel, you lazy workers!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG012subtitle]
*Once built, our tunnels will connect with each other.


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG013subtitle]
*Yesss, use the tunnels to move our forces through Lorien quickly


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG014subtitle]
*First, move our forces into the tunnel, then choose another tunnel from which they will emerge

*How can we conquer the city with this rabble! Bring us more goblins!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG019subtitle]
*The Goblins are ready!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG020subtitle]
*We must summon dark powers to turn the odds of battle in our favor. Choose a power to use against our enemy.


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG021subtitle]
*Once a power has fully charged, select it, and cast it upon a target.


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG022subtitle]
*For every accursed elf and abode we slay, our power will increase. Remember this well and choose new powers when the moment arises!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG023subtitle]
*Cave Trolls are mighty beasts that can swiftly demolish structures - we will need their strength to eradicate the Elven city.


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG024subtitle]
*Build us a Fissure - we can summon the Cave Trolls from there.


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG025subtitle]
*Did you hear me builders?! We need to construct a fissure!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG026subtitle]
*Well done! The Fissure has been completed!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG027subtitle]

[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG033subtitle]
*The Cave Trolls are ready!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG034subtitle]
*We goblins know well the ways of taming the giant spiders. Build a Spider Lair and they will bear us forth to victory!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG035subtitle]
*Where is our Lair? We need the Spider Riders to trample the Elves and their city.


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG036subtitle]
*Good, now that the Spider Lair is complete, create several groups of Spider Riders.


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG037subtitle]
*We need the Spider Riders!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG038subtitle]
*The Spider Riders are ready!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG039subtitle]
*We must defend our fortress if our conquest is to succeed! Select the build plots surrounding our fortress and construct several defensive upgrades!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG040subtitle]
*Choose the upgrades for our fortress from the build plots and construct them!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG041subtitle]
*We cannot leave our fortress defenseless! Choose an upgrade from build plots surrounding the fortress base!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG042subtitle]
*The defenses are complete!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG043subtitle]
*Move our forces across the river!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG044subtitle]
*Excellent. Cross the river and the end of Lorien will begin


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG045subtitle]

[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Mout010subtitle]
*Excellent


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Mout011subtitle]
*You have done well, my servant.


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG046subtitle]
*Well done!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG047subtitle]
*Remember, you can view the objectives should your memory fail you.


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG048subtitle]
*All of our builders have been slain! Create new builders at the fortress.


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG049subtitle]
*The builders can create structures and extend our power over this region.


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG050subtitle]
*One of our leaders has fallen! But all is not lost, for they can be revived at the fortress!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG051subtitle]
*One of our leaders lies wounded in the Fortress - revive him!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG052subtitle]
*Our leader has returned to fight!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG053subtitle]
*Tear down their trees and their homes!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG054subtitle]
*Yesss, with their tree-homes felled, they will find no place to hide!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG055subtitle]
*Why do we tarry, Lorien must fall!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG056subtitle]
*You heard him, move in and free the Giant!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG057subtitle]
*There must be more Giants still held captive.keep searching!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG059subtitle]
*Don't let the trolls near the archers - they will be slain quickly.


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG058subtitle]
*Don't squander the Giant's strength on that rabble - save it for destroying the buildings!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG060subtitle]
*Build another tunnel on the far side of the river, with it, we can move our troops into Lorien quickly!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG061subtitle]
*Our archers are useless against their buildings - bring in the Trolls!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG062subtitle]
*The coward Haldir flees into his forests! Hunt him down!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG063subtitle]
*The elf known as Haldir is their leader - find him and end his wretched existence!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG064subtitle]
*Have we completed all of the objectives?


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Mout012subtitle]
*So! Is this Celeborn appearing to lead his people in their dramatic finale? How endearing! Kill him!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Cele005subtitle]
*By the light of Elbereth. you will perish!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Cele004subtitle]
*By the light of Earendil, you will all perish!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG065subtitle]
*The Elf Lord Celeborn draws breath still - kill him!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Gala003subtitle]
*Celeborn!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG066subtitle]
*There she is - the Witch of the Golden Wood! Kill her!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Mout013subtitle]
*Ahhhhh.the Elf-Witch graces us with her presence...her death will be most exquisite.


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Gala004subtitle]
*Thou shalt feel my wrath, foul Minions of Sauron!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG067subtitle]
*The Elven stronghold still stands - level it to the earth and be done with it!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Mout014subtitle]
*There! The stronghold of Lorien, Caras Galadhon! Raze it to the ground!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Gala005subtitle]
*So.the long defeat comes to this...bitterest of ends. Galadhrim - flee!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Gala006subtitle]
*Ah! I'm wounded!!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Gala007subtitle]
*Ah! I'm hurt!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Mout015subtitle]
*<haughty laughter..>.how tragic!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Mout016subtitle]
*The Elves have tricked and cursed our forces in these parts. Today, that will end.


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG068subtitle]
*We have completed all of the objectives!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_Cors011subtitle]
*Now that we've got the docks, we can build a larger navy.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_Cors012subtitle]
*Build some battleships from the docks, we can use them to assault the grey havens!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_Cors013subtitle]
*Upgrading the ships with pirate flags will make them more powerfull.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_Cors014subtitle]
*Upgrade the ships with additional armor, it'll help us in the battle!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_Cors015subtitle]
*Move out and capture the signal fire to the east!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_Cors016subtitle]
*Select those corsairs then right click on the flag to capture the docks.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_Cors017subtitle]
*We can use transport ships to move troops across water.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_Cors018subtitle]
*Capture the signal fire already! The goblin king is waitin!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_OffG001subtitle]
*The beach is ours! Now build a base and destroy the Elven city!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_OffG002subtitle]
*Get that fortress up! The goblin king has no time for laggards!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_OffG003subtitle]
*We've got to build a base before they counter attack!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_Cors019subtitle]
*Use the bombardment ships to attack structures in the grey havens!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_Cors020subtitle]
*Fireships can be used to take out large concentrations of enemy ships!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_Cors021subtitle]
*Watch out though, those fire ships will hurt us too!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_OffG004subtitle]
*Its an elf counter attack! Prepare the defenses!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_OffG005subtitle]
*Lets get going! We can't waste any more time.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_Cors022subtitle]
*The elves are fleeing the grey havens. Send them to the bottom!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_Cors023subtitle]
*The elves are hiding in the trees! Its an ambush!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_OffG006subtitle]
*Finally! The grey havens! Kill them all, leave none alive!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_Cors024subtitle]
*Destroy their docks! No elf shall leave here alive!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_Elf1002subtitle]
*I knew we should have fled sooner. Now its too late. OH THE HUBRIS!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_Elf1003subtitle]
*Goblins! Run for your lives!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_Elf2002subtitle]
*We can't stop them!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_Elf1004subtitle]
*We're doomed!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_Elf2003subtitle]
*We're all gonna die!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_Cors025subtitle]
*Use the battleships to sink the enemy vessels.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_OffG008subtitle]
*We must eliminate ALL the Dunedain


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_OffG009subtitle]
*The Dunedain still roam these lands. They must ALL DIE!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_OffG010subtitle]
*Wormtongue must die.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_OffG011subtitle]
*We must destroy the seats of power. Only then will the Hobbits succumb to our rule.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_OffG012subtitle]
*There it is, the first seat of power. Destroy it!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_OffG013subtitle]
*Ah ha, another seat of power. Burn it to the ground!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_OffG014subtitle]
*Another seat of power. Rain down destruction upon it.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_OffG015subtitle]
*The final seat of power. Leave not even rubble!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_OffG016subtitle]
*That's one seat of power down, three more to go.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_OffG017subtitle]
*That's two seats of power down, two more to go.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_OffG018subtitle]
*That's three seats of power down, one more to go.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_OffG019subtitle]
*That was the final seat of powernow the Hobbits will crumble before us.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_OffG020subtitle]
*The Dunedain are attacking our base. Drive 'em out!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_OffG021subtitle]
*So, the Dunedain have set up camp here.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_OffG022subtitle]
*Looks like a Dunedain camp. Be wary.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_OffG023subtitle]
*Dunedain tentswatch your backs.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_OffG024subtitle]
*It's Bag End! Hahaeahaa! destroy it!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_OffG025subtitle]
*HmmmLongbottom Farm. Their Pipeweed is of value. Save a space in your gunny sack.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_Dune010subtitle]
*There they are lads! Get 'em.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_OffG026subtitle]
*AMBUSH!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_OffG027subtitle]
*Finally, we've destroyed that hobbit hole, Bag End! Heaha!!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEForno_OffG014subtitle]
*Those walls won't keep us out. Goblins, scale the walls!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEForno_OffG015subtitle]
*The Main Gate is breached! Storm the Castle!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEForno_OffG016subtitle]
*The Earth Hammer is no more! Now it is time for our own weapon. We can summon the Watcher now!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_OffM014subtitle]
*We've got to move out and find the Dragon Lord.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_OffM015subtitle]
*Men of Dale are guarding the path to the Dragon Lord's lair. Bring up the drakes!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_OffM016subtitle]
*The dwarves are holding the drakes captive! Free them and perhaps they will join our side.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_OffM017subtitle]
*The Dragon Lord will be pleased we have freed these drakes, bring them too him and he may join our cause.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_OffM018subtitle]
*Dragons are attacking the Dwarves! Lets aid them in elimating the dwarf menace.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_OffM019subtitle]
*We've freed the drakes and now they fight for us!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_OffM020subtitle]
*There are still more drakes being held by the dwarves. Let's go free them.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_OffM021subtitle]
*We've freed all the drakes. Now we must find the Dragon Lord and bring them to him.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_OffM022subtitle]
*These drakes are a powerfull ally, use them to wipe out the dwarves.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_OffM023subtitle]
*Hurry, we must free the drakes before it's too late.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_OffM024subtitle]

[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_Mout013subtitle]
*I bid thee fair tidings. I wish to treat with thee on behalf of Sauron the Great.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_Mout014subtitle]
*We are at war with the Dwarves. Dragon Lord, Join us and we will eradicate them from Mount Erebor.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_Mout015subtitle]
*The Men of Dale are guarding the path to the Dragon Lord's lair. Bring up the drakes!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_Mout016subtitle]
*The dwarves are holding the drakes captive! Free them and perhaps they will join our side.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_Mout017subtitle]
*The Dragon Lord will be pleased we have freed these drakes, bring them too him and he may join our cause.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_Mout018subtitle]
*Dragons are attacking the Dwarves! Let's aid them in elimating the dwarf menace.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_Mout019subtitle]
*We've freed the drakes and now they fight for us!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_Mout020subtitle]
*There are still more drakes being held by the dwarves. Let's go free them.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_Mout021subtitle]
*We've freed all the drakes. Now we must find the Dragon Lord and bring them to him.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_Mout022subtitle]
*These drakes are a powerfull ally. Use them to wipe out the dwarves.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_Mout023subtitle]
*Hurry, we must free the drakes before its too late.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_Mout024subtitle]
*All the drakes are freed! Bring them to the Dragon Lord.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_OffM025subtitle]
*We must not allow many more drakes to perish, we need to bring them to the Dragon Lord.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_OffM026subtitle]
*Knock down the gate and the drakes will be free!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_OffM027subtitle]
*Once we break down that gate, the drakes will fight for us!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_OffM028subtitle]
*Take down that gate. We must free the drakes!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_OffM029subtitle]
*The gate is destroyed! Drakes, wreak havoc upon the dwarves!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_OffM030subtitle]
*Bring the drakes to the Dragon Lord! Sauron cannot wait!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_OffM031subtitle]
*Kick down the gate! Free the drakes!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_OffM032subtitle]
*A dwarf counter attack! Destroy them all!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEErebo_OffM025subtitle]
*Combine the fire of the catapults and set the land ablaze.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEErebo_OffM026subtitle]
*Destroy the town buildings to make room for our encampment!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEErebo_OffM027subtitle]
*What are you waiting for?!? Destroy those homes!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEErebo_OffM028subtitle]
*The homes of the town must be demolished.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEErebo_OffM029subtitle]
*Set the city of Dale ablaze!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEErebo_OffM030subtitle]
*Raze the buildings of Dale with these catapults.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEErebo_OffM031subtitle]
*Use the siege party to lay waste to the town's buildings.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEErebo_OffM032subtitle]
*A party of Dwarves approach form the Southwest, be wary!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEErebo_OffM033subtitle]
*It's the fool Gloin! He's rallied the dwarves of the Iron Hills!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEErebo_OffM034subtitle]
*Gloin has rallied the Blue Mountain dwarvesthe genocide will be complete!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEErebo_OffM035subtitle]
*Bring the Dragons down upon their bald stunty heads!


[DIALOGEVENT:MERiven_OffG013subtitle]
*Oh look, the last of the Dunedain have joined the fight. Kill them.


[DIALOGEVENT:MERiven_OffG014subtitle]
*Gandalf has brought his party of fools. Destroy them.


[DIALOGEVENT:MERiven_OffG015subtitle]
*Mordor has sent us some catapults to help break into Rivendell!


[DIALOGEVENT:MERiven_OffG016subtitle]
*The Witch King has brought some Nazgûl to deal with the Eagles.


[DIALOGEVENT:MERiven_OffG017subtitle]
*The fury of Mount Doom has risen. The Rain of Fire Power is within reach.


[DIALOGEVENT:MERiven_OffG018subtitle]
*The 'King' of Gondor must be punished for his insolence! Bring us the head of Arwen!


[DIALOGEVENT:MERiven_OffG019subtitle]
*Bring us the head of Arwen


[DIALOGEVENT:MERiven_OffG020subtitle]
*Aragorn will pay for his attacks against Sauron, murder his true loveArwen.


[DIALOGEVENT:MERiven_OffG021subtitle]
*These Heroes bring hope to the people of Middle-earthAnnihilate them.


[DIALOGEVENT:MERiven_OffG022subtitle]
*The House of Elrond is well defended, destroy it and the surrounding fortresses.


[DIALOGEVENT:MERiven_OffG023subtitle]
*The army of the dead! We must steel our defenses!


[DIALOGEVENT:MERiven_OffG024subtitle]
*Destroy their fortresses and the House of Elrond!


[DIALOGEVENT:MERiven_Elf1004subtitle]
*Defend the HOUSE! They must not get close.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT001subtitle]
*Welcome mlord to the White Mountains. Weve long awaited your arrival.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT002subtitle]
*This pass has long been forgotten and as a result Goblins from the Misty Mountains have ventured all the way south and infested this area. If we dont do something about them quickly they may spread all the way to Minas Tirith


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT003subtitle]
*But first, well have to get you battle worthy for the task ahead


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT004subtitle]
*Moving around the field of battle is important in controlling your army.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT005subtitle]
*To navigate the map, hold down the right mouse button and move your mouse around.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT006subtitle]
*You can also use the arrow keys on your keyboard to do this.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT007subtitle]
*Excellent! I see youve brought some soldiers with you. Left click on them with your cursor.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT008subtitle]
*Now that you have them selected, move them into the camp by right clicking on the ground in the spotlight up ahead.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT009subtitle]
*Those spotlights will help guide you through this mission, so keep an eye out for them.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT010subtitle]
*Now for our mission here; The Goblins have been raiding our camps and need to be dealt with quickly. We need you to lead this battle.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT011subtitle]
*Currently you know how to select one battalion of units, but youll need to know how to select an army.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT012subtitle]
*In order to select multiple battalions quickly, click and hold the left mouse button down on empty space and drag your mouse. A selection box will appear and any units that are in this box will be selected for you.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT013subtitle]
*Select the battalions in the spotlights by using the selection box method.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT014subtitle]
*Good job! Now, move those units up to the spotlight ahead by right clicking on the ground with them selected.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT015subtitle]
*The Goblins are attacking! We need to send reinforcements!


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT016subtitle]
*Select your army again using the selection box method.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT017subtitle]
*Now issue them an attack command by right clicking on those Goblins down there. Youll notice that as you move your cursor over the Goblins, it changes to a Red Attack Cursor. This Red Attack cursor will indicate what is an enemy to you.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT018subtitle]
*Hurry, theyve almost destroyed the camp down there! Issue your attack order by selecting your units and right clicking on those enemy Goblins!


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT019subtitle]
*Congratulations, youve just won your first battle. Unfortunately, our celebration will have to wait. More reports are coming in that other camps are being attacked and need support.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT020subtitle]
*A quick way to find out where you need to go is by looking at the Palantir. The Palantir is located at the bottom left of your screen. Within it you'll find the mini-map.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT021subtitle]
*The mini-map is an overhead view of the entire map. Currently the camp locations on the mini map are being flashed.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT022subtitle]
*White flashes inform you of objective locations. While a red flash would indicate where your forces are being attacked.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT023subtitle]
*On the Palantir you'll find the Objectives Menu. If you forget what your current objective is, click on that button and it will be displayed.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT024subtitle]
*Click on the Objective button now to see what your current objective is.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT025subtitle]
*There are two types of objectives, Main Objectives and Bonus Objectives. Main Objectives appear in white text and need to be accomblished in order to complete a mission.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT026subtitle]
*Bonus Objectives appear in green text. You may choose to complete them, but they wont count against you if you dont.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT027subtitle]
*And finally, any Objective with a check mark in its box is one that youve completed.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT028subtitle]
*To exit the Objectives Screen, click on the Resume Game button at the bottom.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT029subtitle]
*Now, move your army to those camps and help eliminate the Goblin threats.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_Sold001subtitle]
*Thank you, sir! We should be fine from now on. Hurry though, the other outpost is still under attack.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_Sold002subtitle]
*A giant! Slay the beast before it makes it to the outpost!


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_Sold003subtitle]
*You came just in time. We werent sure how much longer we could have held them off.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT030subtitle]
*Well done! All the camps are now secure and the road between them is safe.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT031subtitle]
*While our camps up here are sufficient to hold this road, its not strong enough to hold this mountain. We need to setup a larger camp, but well need a great deal of land with which to do so.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT032subtitle]
*Up ahead is just such an expanse of land, but it is held by Spider Lairs. These lairs are infested with creatures that have no allegiance to anyone save their own. Fortunately the creatures wont stray far from their lairs, so they only pose a threat in their immediate area.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT033subtitle]
*Clear those lairs out and we should be able to establish our new camp here.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT034subtitle]
*When a lair is destroyed, it will leave behind rubble. You will also need to destroy the rubble or else the lair will rebuild itself and the creatures will come forth from it again.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT035subtitle]
*After you destroy a lair, it will leave some money behind. Thats the treasure that theyve hoarded from killing wanderers whove ventured too close to them.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT036subtitle]
*Excellent! An abandoned Outpost. We can capture this building for our own.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT037subtitle]
*To capture this outpost, select a battalion, and right click on the flag next to the outpost.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT038subtitle]
*While the building is being captured, it's current flag will lower, and our flag will raise in its place.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT039subtitle]
*The outpost is ours! It will now provide further resources for our army.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT040subtitle]
*Now to get started on our camp.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT041subtitle]
*We sent a builder your way for constructing our new camp. Builders are what you use to construct all the buildings well need in order to establish a camp.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT042subtitle]
*First and foremost well need a Fortress.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT043subtitle]
*To build a fortress, while having your Builder selected, left click on the Fortress button which is flashing now.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT044subtitle]
*In order to place down a building, left click anywhere on the land. For this base however, well need you to place your fortress within the spotlighted area.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT045subtitle]
*While our fortress is building, let me tell you a bit about it. Fortresses can produce more Builders, as well as Heroes such as our Lord Boromir.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT046subtitle]
*They also have many upgrades available to them, but well get to that another time.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT047subtitle]
*Now that we have a fortress built, well need an economy to fund our defenses.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT048subtitle]
*Select the builder and build a Farm on the spotlight in the upper left. As you place the farm down, notice that it has a percentage attached to it. This percentage will tell you how productive it will be, given its current location on land.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT049subtitle]
*Things such as mountains, water, or other obstacles will reduce the productivity of a Farm. The resources farms produce can be tracked by the number at the bottom left of the Palantir.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT050subtitle]
*Farms contribute to your army's Command Point Limit. So the more farms you build, the more battalions you can command.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT051subtitle]
*Your Command Point Limit can be tracked by the number at the bottom right of the Palantir.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT052subtitle]
*We now need to build up some structures to train more units for our army.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT053subtitle]
*Select the builder again and build a Barracks on the next spotlight.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT054subtitle]
*The Barracks will be able to produce Soldiers as well as Tower Guards.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT055subtitle]
*The last thing well need is an Archery Range. Build one of those on the other spotlight.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT056subtitle]
*From here we can train Archers and Rangers.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT057subtitle]
*As well as having structures, our base will need fortifications.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT058subtitle]
*In order to fortify our base, well need to setup wall spans. Wall spans begin with wall hubs, which can be built from either our fortress or from our Builders.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT059subtitle]
*In order to build them from the fortress, click on the build plot highlighted.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT060subtitle]
*Notice the different options of things you can build. One of them is the Wall Hub. Click on that button to begin building it now.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT061subtitle]
*Click on the wall hub button to begin building it.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT062subtitle]
*Now that the Wall Hub is completed, you can select it. This will bring up a wall expanse button.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT063subtitle]
*Click that button and move your cursor to the Spotlight to the right. As you move your mouse youll see a see-through wall; this is how your wall will look when youve finished building it.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT064subtitle]
*To build it, left click on the ground where the Spotlight is.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT065subtitle]
*Now, click on the wall hub you just built in the Spotlight and build another wall expanse off to the south along the ridge. Another Spotlight is setup showing you where your wall should end.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT066subtitle]
*Excellent, now repeat what you just did on the northern side of our fortress. Select the build plot highlighted and build a wall span to the Spotlight to the right. Then build to the next spotlight in the north.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT067subtitle]
*Excellent job! Our camp is better defended but still not impenetrable. We will need to build wall DEFENSES.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT068subtitle]
*You may upgrade a wall with offensive structures such as Arrow Towers and Trebuchets. Or you can build Postern Gates and Large Gates with which to move your armies through. You may also turn it into another wall HUB.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT069subtitle]
*A good wall defense is the Trebuchet. Select any wall segment and build a Trebuchet upgrade on it.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT070subtitle]
*Our base has begun. Now lets build some units to defend it. Train 2 battalions of Gondor Soldiers from the Barracks now.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT071subtitle]
*Great! Now train two battalions of Gondor Archers from the Archery Range.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT072subtitle]
*And lastly, well need a Hero to lead our troops. Heroes can be purchased from the Fortress. And if your Hero should fall in battle, they can be revived from the fortress as well.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT073subtitle]
*To summon a Hero, select your fortress and click on the Heroes button. This will bring up options of all the current Heroes youre allowed to build. Right now Boromir is residing in our fortress.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT074subtitle]
*Click on his portrait to summon him.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT075subtitle]
*Welcome Lord Boromir! Heroes in general have an array of special powers and abilities that make them unique and vital for a strong army. Select Boromir now.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT076subtitle]
*You will find a Heros abilities on the Palantir. Some are Passive abilities which mean theyre always enabled such as Boromirs Leadership ability.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT077subtitle]
*Others powers can be set to \"autocast\" by right clicking its button in the palantir. You will see its outline sparkle when this is enabled.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT078subtitle]
*Right click on Boromir's Horn of Gondor ability to set it to autocast.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT079subtitle]
*Our army is built now and Gondors new castle is ready. Excellent work! You're now ready to command an army and defend these passes.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_Sold004subtitle]
*The Goblins, theyre here! A large force has gathered and is marching towards this very spot.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT080subtitle]
*There is no time to waste. Mlord, you will have to defend this base as youve done before with the camps.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT081subtitle]
*Remember, select your army and right click on the enemy units to issue attack orders. You can select one battalion at a time and issue them attack orders to specific enemy battalions.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT082subtitle]
*The Eagles have come! By the glory of Gondor, we shall send these goblins back to their netherworld!


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT083subtitle]
*Victory is ours! Great job my lord! That ought to send those Goblins back to their caves.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT084subtitle]
*Come back when youre ready to finish them off by playing through the Advanced Tutorial.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT001subtitle]
*Welcome back Mlord! As you can see weve been very busy here, but the attacks have yet to stop.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT002subtitle]
*The Goblins seem to be coming from across the river. I suggest we take the fight to their base!


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT003subtitle]
*Before we move forward however, I would like to teach you some of the tactics that our battalions have been working on.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT004subtitle]
*Each Battalion can enter a particular attack mode, or what we refer to as Stances. These stances can boost their power or defense. Click on the Gondor Soldier Battalion in the Spotlight.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT005subtitle]
*The Stances button is located on the Palantir. If you click on it, it will bring up a menu with 3 stances to choose from.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT006subtitle]
*The Aggressive Stance will increase a units offensive capabilities while decreasing their defensive capabilities.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT007subtitle]
*The Battle Stance is the default stance for all units and renders no bonuses or negatives to a units abilities.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT008subtitle]
*And the Hold Ground Stance will greatly increase a units defensive capabilities while decreasing their offensive capabilities.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT009subtitle]
*Set the battalion you have selected into its Aggressive Stance by clicking on the Aggressive Stance button.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT010subtitle]
*Excellent! Now let's have our army form up into a battle line.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT012subtitle]
*Now press and hold both the right and left mouse buttons and drag your mouse. Youll notice that a Formation Preview will display on the ground. Once you release the mouse buttons, your units will form up into this battle line.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT013subtitle]
*Now back to the matter at hand. We must take our army across the river and over to the enemy's base. In order to do so we will need a Shipwright.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT014subtitle]
*There's a shipwright to the East of here along the river.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT015subtitle]
*Move a battalion to the shipwright and capture it. Remember, to capture it, right click on the flag next to it while having a battalion selected.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT016subtitle]
*The shipwright is ours! Selecting it will bring up options of different types of vessels you may purchase.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT017subtitle]
*The Transport will ferry your troops across large bodies of water.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT018subtitle]
*Battleships will help destroy enemy ships that impede your way.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT019subtitle]
*It appears as though Gondor has sent reinforcements to aid us in our reclaiming of this mountain. Lets join up with them by building a transport of our own. Select the shipwright and click on the Transport button to begin building one.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT020subtitle]
*Now select your battalion and right click on the Transport. Youll notice that your cursor changes to a garrison icon. Other structures in Middle-earth can be garrisoned as well, so keep an eye out for that icon.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT021subtitle]
*Great, now move your transport into the spotlight to join up with the rest of the convoy.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT022subtitle]
*A Nazgûl! Watch out!


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT023subtitle]
*It took out one of the transports! Hurry, get to the beach quickly!


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT024subtitle]
*Take down those Corsair ships! Send them to bottom of the river!


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT025subtitle]
*Youve made it across, MLord. Well done. In order to deploy your units from a transport, select the transport ship and give it a move order on land.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT026subtitle]
*Theres one of their camps up ahead. Well have to rush them before they have a chance to retreat and warn any others. Issue an \"Attack MOVE\" order and that should take care of them.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT027subtitle]
*To issue an \"Attack Move\" order, select your army and press the A key on your keyboard. This will change your cursor to an Attack Move cursor.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT028subtitle]
*Then, right click on the ground in the spotlight behind the camp. This will send your army on a path of destruction to that point, killing every enemy they encounter.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT029subtitle]
*It appears as though some of the Goblins have retreated over that wall. Unfortunately Goblins are able to scale walls by climbing them whereas we are not. Nor do we have any siege weapons to take down those walls quickly.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT030subtitle]
*Well have to call in for greater powers to help us progress any farther.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT031subtitle]
*At your disposal is a list of powers that can be purchased from the Evenstar icon located on the Palantir. Click on the Evenstar icon now.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT032subtitle]
*As you can see, all the powers are tiered, which means you have to purchase the lower costing powers in order to access the more expensive ones.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT033subtitle]
*In order to purchase a power, you must have power points equal to or greater than the number associated with that power.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT034subtitle]
*Go ahead and purchase the Arrow Volley and Earthquake power. They are currently the only ones available to buy.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT035subtitle]
*To exit, click on the Accept button at the bottom of the screen.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT036subtitle]
*Every time you buy a new power, it will appear on the left hand side of your screen just above the Palantir.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT037subtitle]
*Now back to the battle. First lets take down those Goblins taunting us from the other side of the wall. Left click on the Arrow Volley power and move your cursor over the goblins.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT038subtitle]
*To cast the power, left click on the ground.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT040subtitle]
*That got 'em good! Keep in mind that certain powers such as Arrow Volley can only be cast in areas that are visible to you.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT041subtitle]
*Now to get past this wall. Unfortunately the gate is in disrepair and cannot be opened, so well have to destroy these walls.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT042subtitle]
*The Earthquake power will deal a significant amount of damage to these walls and should be enough to clear our path.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT043subtitle]
*Left click on the Earthquake power now and left click underneath those walls to cast it.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT044subtitle]
*Left click on the Earthquake power now and right click underneath those walls to cast it.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT045subtitle]
*Excellent! The Goblins main base is not much farther off. Continue north along the path and be wary of any more camps you encounter.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_Sold001subtitle]
*MLord, we are glad you have come. Weve been keeping an eye on this Goblin camp and have setup a trap for them. All we need to do is set the forest ablaze around them and it should spread into their camp.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT046subtitle]
*Fire, MLord, has become a valuable asset as of late. Unfortunately in our enemies hands it could also be a serious danger.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT047subtitle]
*Select the Rangers who have joined you and have them volley their arrows into the spotlights. This will start a fire there and youll be able to watch it spread into the enemy's base, setting it ablaze and destroying their structures.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT048subtitle]
*That was the last of their camps, their main base is just to the west. We should move quickly lest they assemble and come to meet us unprepared.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT049subtitle]
*The final battle at last. They seem unaware of our presence. This should prove extremely useful.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT050subtitle]
*To truly have this battle work to our advantage, we should use Planning Mode. To enter this mode, click on the Planning Mode button located on the Palantir.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT051subtitle]
*In Planning Mode, you can issue orders for every one of your units, and then have them execute those orders simultaneously.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT052subtitle]
*If at any time you make a mistake and want to change the order for a particular unit, select the unit and press the Delete Action button. This will remove the last order you gave them, and continue until they have no orders at all.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT053subtitle]
*Now lets devise a plan to crush every last one of those nasty Goblins! First, I recommend \"Attack Moving\" with your cavalry at those Goblin Warriors in the northern most part of the base. Do so by selecting your cavalry, pressing A on your keyboard, and left clicking on the ground in the middle of those Goblins.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT054subtitle]
*You may also notice that those Goblins have their backs turned to you. This will result in the cavalry flanking those units. Any time a unit is flanked, it will receive more damage from its attackers.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT055subtitle]
*Next, I would recommend taking the Rangers that joined you and have them cast their volley on the hill to the south of the base. The fire that you start there should spread to the Giant and burn him to the ground!


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT056subtitle]
*Last, Id send the remaining forces you have into the heart of their base and kill every last one of them. Try splitting your forces amongst the different targets in their base.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT057subtitle]
*When youre plan has been laid out, hit the execute button and your army will march forth with their orders.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT058subtitle]
*Were winning MLord, but their fortress is killing our army. Use your earthquake power again on their Fortress and it should take down their defenses!


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT059subtitle]
*Victory is ours! The Goblin threat has been eliminated once and for all in this mountain pass. Minas Tirith will be pleased to hear of our victory and may sleep safely knowing this pass is once again controlled by Gondor.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT060subtitle]
*And you, MLord are now ready to vanquish more evil from Middle-earth. Take with you all that you have learned and try a campaign, a skirmish versus the AI, or a multiplayer match online against your friends!


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial001subtitle]
*Welcome to the War Of The Ring tutorial.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial002subtitle]
*Here you will learn the basics of how to build an empire to rule them all.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial003subtitle]
*The War Of The Ring is a turn-based strategic game of territory conquest, resource management, and epic confrontations that takes place over the lands of Middle-earth.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial004subtitle]
*The game is played on the living world map.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial005subtitle]
*Territories that are under your control will be highlighted with your color and territories claimed by your enemies will be highlighted with their respective colors.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial006subtitle]
*To zoom in and out of the map, push the mouse wheel forward and backward.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial007subtitle]
*To scroll through the map, push your cursor towards the edge of the screen to move in that direction.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial008subtitle]
*Try moving around the map now.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial009subtitle]
*That's it! Very good!


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial010subtitle]
*The game is played as a series of turns that are taken simultaneously by all players.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial011subtitle]
*A single turn is divided into 3 phases: Tactical, Battle, and Retreat.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial012subtitle]
*The current phase of a turn is always displayed in the phase indicator at the top of the screen. Below the phase indicator is an expandable window that displays critical tasks and provides gameplay hints for the current phase.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial013subtitle]
*Each phase must be completed by all players before the game continues to the next phase. When all phases have been completed, the turn is over and a new turn begins.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial014subtitle]
*Turn 1


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial015subtitle]
*Tactical Phase


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial016subtitle]
*In the tactical phase, you will make all your strategic choices regarding the expansion of your kingdom.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial017subtitle]
*Structure Construction, Unit Training, and Army Movement are all decided in this phase.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial018subtitle]
*First, you will focus on structure construction in the tactical phase of this turn.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial019subtitle]
*Structure Construction


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial020subtitle]
*You can construct new buildings on any open build plot in a territory you control.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial021subtitle]
*There are four basic structure classes to choose from, Fortress, Barracks, Armory, and Farm. Each structure class provides a necessary function to a growing empire.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial022subtitle]
*Build fortresses to strengthen the defenses in your territories. Build barracks to train new units for your armies. Build armories to improve your armies attack and defensive capabilities. And build farms to support the population growth of your empire.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial023subtitle]
*To build a new structure, left click on a build plot to bring up the menu that shows all the available buildings that can be constructed. Then left click on the building you want to construct.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial024subtitle]
*Select the open build plot in Cair Andros and build a barracks.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial025subtitle]
*Good job!


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial026subtitle]
*All structures cost a number of turns to build and only one structure per territory can be under construction at a time.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial027subtitle]
*Once all players have completed the tactical phase, the strategic choices of each player are revealed on the living world map, and the game continues to the next phase.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial028subtitle]
*Since you are not going to construct any more buildings at this time, press the End Phase button to finish the tactical phase.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial029subtitle]
*Battle Phase


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial030subtitle]
*In the Battle Phase, all conflicts between opposing players are fought.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial031subtitle]
*A battle occurs when at least one of your armies and one of your enemy's armies end up in the same territory after the planned moves are executed from the tactical phase.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial032subtitle]
*Since there are not any conflicts at this time, the game will continue to the next phase.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial033subtitle]
*Retreat Phase


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial034subtitle]
*In the Retreat phase, all armies lead by Heroes that are defeated in battle must withdraw to safe territories.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial035subtitle]
*Since you do not have any defeated Hero armies at this time, the game will continue to the next phase.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial036subtitle]
*Now that all phases have been finished, a single turn in War Of The Ring is completed. A new turn begins and you start again at the tactical phase.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial037subtitle]
*Turn 2


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial038subtitle]
*Tactical Phase


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial039subtitle]
*The barracks you started to build in the previous turn has been completed and its abilities are now available for you to use.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial040subtitle]
*Next, you will concentrate on unit training in the tactical phase of this turn.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial041subtitle]
*Unit Training


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial042subtitle]
*Command points represent the number of troops you are allowed to train. You can not build more troops than you have command points.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial043subtitle]
*Your world command point limit indicates the current population of your empire that inhabits the whole of Middle-earth. It is displayed at the top left corner of the screen.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial044subtitle]
*The number of units that can reside in each army and territory are also bound by their own command point limits.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial045subtitle]
*You can train new units at any one of your barracks.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial046subtitle]
*There are four basic unit classes to choose from, Soldier, Archer, Pikeman, and Cavalry. Each unit class has their own distinct traits and capabilities when fighting the other unit classes.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial047subtitle]
*To train a new battalion, left click on a barracks to bring up the menu that shows all the available units that can be trained. Then left click on the unit you want to train.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial048subtitle]
*Select the barracks in Cair Andros and train a battalion of troops.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial049subtitle]
*Well done!


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial050subtitle]
*All battalions cost a number of turns to train and only one set of troops per barracks can be in training at a time.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial051subtitle]
*Since you are not going to train any more units at this time, press the End Phase button to finish the tactical phase.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial052subtitle]
*Again, no conflicts have occurred, so the game will pass through the battle and retreat phases.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial053subtitle]
*The turn is finished and now another turn begins.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial054subtitle]
*Turn 3


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial055subtitle]
*Tactical Phase


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial056subtitle]
*The battalion you started to train in the previous turn has been completed and is now available for you to command into battle.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial057subtitle]
*Finally, you will learn army movement in the tactical phase of this turn.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial058subtitle]
*Army Movement


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial059subtitle]
*All armies are allowed to move to only 1 adjacent territory from their current location per turn. However, the choice of an army's destination depends on the type of army that is being moved.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial060subtitle]
*There are 2 types of armies under your command, Garrison Armies, and Hero Armies.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial061subtitle]
*A garrison army is composed of all the troop battalions that reside in a territory.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial062subtitle]
*To examine the composition of an army, left click to select an army. Then left click on the Selection Details button on the Palantir at the lower left of the screen. This will reveal a panel that shows the individual battalions and units that make up the selected army.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial063subtitle]
*Select the garrison army in Cair Andros and examine its composition by displaying the details panel.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial064subtitle]
*Observe that the battalion you just trained appears here.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial065subtitle]
*From this panel, detailed stats for each battalion in an army can be seen, and commands to the individual battalions themselves can be given.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial066subtitle]
*Garrison armies are used to defend the lands of your empire and can only move between territories that you control. Thus, they cannot take over neutral territories or invade enemy territories on their own. However, a garrison army can join with a Hero army to strengthen a Hero army's attacking forces.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial067subtitle]
*To order a garrison army to join a Hero army, left click to select a garrison army. Then right click on the desired Hero army to have the battalions of your selected army merge with the Hero forces.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial068subtitle]
*Notice that your cursor changes to a join icon when you have a garrison army selected and move your mouse over a Hero army that it can legally join.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial069subtitle]
*Order the garrison army in Cair Andros to join Aragorn's army in Rohan.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial070subtitle]
*Excellent!


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial071subtitle]
*A Hero army is a group of battalions that are commanded by a special Hero that has the ability to lead troops into battle. They can not only move between territories that you control, but are also used to expand the lands of your kingdom by conquering neutral territories and invading enemy territories.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial072subtitle]
*Acquiring territories collects bonuses for your empire.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial073subtitle]
*To order a Hero army to move into a territory, left click to select a Hero army. Then right click on the desired territory to send your selected Hero army to that location.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial074subtitle]
*Notice that your cursor changes to a movement icon when you have an army selected and move your mouse over a territory that it can legally travel into.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial075subtitle]
*Select Aragorn's army in Rohan and move into The Dead Marshes.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial076subtitle]
*Very good!


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial077subtitle]
*Since you are not going to move any more armies at this time, press the End Phase button to finish the tactical phase.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial078subtitle]
*Battle Phase


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial079subtitle]
*This time during the battle phase there are encounters with the enemy that must be resolved.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial080subtitle]
*Active battles are indicated by an animated battle marker.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial081subtitle]
*To settle the encounter, left click the battle marker.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial082subtitle]
*Select the battle marker in Osgiliath to resolve the conflict.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial083subtitle]
*This battle screen shows you detailed information about your forces and the enemy forces involved in the skirmish in the contested territory.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial084subtitle]
*You may have up to 3 methods for handling an encounter: Auto-Resolve, Realtime, or Retreat.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial085subtitle]
*Selecting Auto-Resolve will calculate the winner of the battle automatically based on factors such as the size, unit composition, and experience of the forces involved.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial086subtitle]
*Selecting Realtime will allow you to manually fight the battle in the disputed territory.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial087subtitle]
*Selecting Retreat will allow you to withdraw your forces from the conflict before the battle starts. However, your retreating armies may lose some units in the process.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial088subtitle]
*When the battle has been resolved, ownership of the territory will be awarded to the winner.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial089subtitle]
*For the purposes of the tutorial, all battles will be auto-resolved.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial090subtitle]
*Press the Auto-Resolve button to fight the battle in Osgiliath.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial091subtitle]
*You lost this battle, but not the war. Don't give up.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial092subtitle]
*During the Battle phase there may be multiple conflicts. Each conflict is resolved one at a time.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial093subtitle]
*Select the battle marker in The Dead Marshes to resolve the conflict.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial094subtitle]
*You have defeated the enemy! Well done!


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial095subtitle]
*Once all battles have been resolved, the battle phase is over.


[DIALOGEVENT:WOTR_Tutorial096subtitle]
*Press the End Phase button to finish the battle phase.

[SCRIPT:HighPass_ExtraCampaignText]
The attack on Rivendell came from farther North - but before we can track the evil to its source, we must clear High Pass of the Goblin invaders.


[SCRIPT:Ettenmoors_ExtraCampaignText]
In days of old, the Ettenmoors were home to the Witch-king of Angmar. Now the new Goblin Leader has taken these lands for his own. Goblin armies spread wildly through the mountains and will threaten Rivendell again if we dont stop them here.


[SCRIPT:Shire_ExtraCampaignText]
The Hobbits of The Shire have caused our Dark Lord much trouble. Our domination of Eriador would not be complete without crushing this pocket of resistance.


[SCRIPT:Shire_ExtraCampaignTextAgain]
Now listen up...the Hobbits have four Seats of Power. Destroy these buildings, and we quell whatever hope they might have for reprisal.


[SCRIPT:Fornost_ExtraCampaignText]
The remaining Dunedain of this region have rallied the help of the Blue Mountain Dwarves. It is in the old fortress of Fornost where they will see their last moments. Once our work here is done, all of the lands West of the Misty Mountains will be ours!


[SCRIPT:Mirkwood_ExtraCampaignText]
The northern lands of Mirkwood are the home of the Wood-elves. The first step in expelling them from their forest home is to seize the Old Forest Road. Once we control this road, we can dominate the rest of Mirkwood with ease.


[SCRIPT:WitheredHeath_ExtraCampaignText]
We must earn favor with the dragons here. Destroy any Dwarf settlements you encounter.


[SCRIPT:WitheredHeath_ExtraCampaignText_Again]
The Dwarves are capturing the Dragons when they are still young. These Drakes can be very powerful. Free any Drakes that they might have captured, and they will join us against the Dwarves!


[SCRIPT:Erebor_ExtraCampaignText]
Our supply lines are thin. Pillage Dale for any resources you can find. Then lay siege to the Dwarven mountain fortress of Erebor. Shelob and the spiders of Mirkwood have been sent as scouts due to their speed and their appetite for destruction.


[SCRIPT:Rivendell_ExtraCampaignText]
Frodo, the free peoples last hope, lies dead. Gorkil begins the siege of Rivendell while the Dark Lord makes his way west. Crush the last haven for the Elves.

*Goblins? Here? Must be stragglers from the Ettenmoors. No mind, we'll kill 'em anyway.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_OffD025subtitle]
*Spiders. I bleeding hate Spiders.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGBlueM_OffD026subtitle]
*By me mothers mud-caked beard, there be cave trolls here!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE051subtitle]
*The Corsair Ships approach from the south. We must build transport ships to move our battalions across the waters and capture their shipyards.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE052subtitle]
*We must reclaim our shipyards!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE053subtitle]
*We must reclaim our shipyards to combat the Corsairs with vessels of our own!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE054subtitle]
*The enemy has landed on our western shores. Fend them off!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE055subtitle]
*Build transport ships to move our battalions across the waters.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE056subtitle]
*The Shipwrights have crafted us an enchanted vessel - the Storm Ship. When it rams into enemies, it creates a swirling vortex that will sink ally and foe alike.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGGreyH_OffE057subtitle]
*The lore of our Shipwrights is unparalleled, but remember to upgrade our naval vessels!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_OffD015subtitle]
*By the Hammer of Gloin, we're cut off.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_OffD016subtitle]
*This battle has gone ill - our forces scattered, the settlement overrun. We need the luck of the gods or all will be lost.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_OffD017subtitle]
*We're outnumbered ten to one. We must find our scattered warriors and lead 'em to the docks. Only then can we stand a chance against all those bleedin' orcs.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_OffD018subtitle]
*We must get back to the docks and the rest of our forces, or we're as good as dead.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_Meno003subtitle]
*Dáin? Is it really you?


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_OffD019subtitle]
*King Dáin! I thought you were dead.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_OffD020subtitle]
*Get over here, we're on our last legs.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_OffD021subtitle]
*King Dáin! You're a sight for sore eyes.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_OffD022subtitle]
*Black Riders? Here? That can't be good.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_OffD023subtitle]
*Bleedin' Fell Beast. Don't trust nothin' that don't walk on the ground.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_Elf1001subtitle]
*AGHKAHHHHH!!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGCeldu_Elf1002subtitle]
*Help us! HEEELP!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD036subtitle]
*Our defenses can't repel an army of that size!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD037subtitle]
*Take these forces out into Dale and begin fortifying the city!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD038subtitle]
*Begin fortifying Dale with these forces.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD039subtitle]
*Reinforce Dale to buy time so that we can build up a defense inside Erebor.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD040subtitle]
*Defeat the first wave of Mordor attackers.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD041subtitle]
*The first wave of Mordor attackers has been defeated.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD042subtitle]
*That's it for the first wave. Prepare for the next attack!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD043subtitle]
*It's the second wave!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD044subtitle]
*That's it for the second wave. Prepare for the next attack!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD045subtitle]
*It's the third wave!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD046subtitle]
*That's it for the third wave. Prepare for another attack!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD047subtitle]
*Here they are again! It's the fourth wave!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD048subtitle]
*We've defeated the fourth wave!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD049subtitle]
*Here they come again!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD050subtitle]
*We've defeated them!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD051subtitle]
*Defeat the Mouth of Sauron and his forces!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD052subtitle]
*The Mouth of Sauron and his forces have been defeated.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD053subtitle]
*Destroy the Mordor encampment.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD054subtitle]
*Build walls to defend Dale from the Mordor assault.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD055subtitle]
*Great! These walls will do!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD056subtitle]
*They're summoning a Rain of fire!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD057subtitle]
*They've awoken a Wyrm in Dale!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD058subtitle]
*There's a Wyrm destroying the city!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD059subtitle]
*Surely, we'll need an army bigger then this surely! They're bringing TROLLS!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD060subtitle]
*Build more defensive structures. They're our only hope of stopping them.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_Dwar008subtitle]
*<gasp> Thats a lot of trolls!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_Dwar009subtitle]
*By my mother's beard, have you ever seen so many trolls?


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_Dwar010subtitle]
*There's too many of them! FALL BACK!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD061subtitle]
*Look out! The Mouth of Sauron has found a secret entry!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD062subtitle]
*He's inside the mountain!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD063subtitle]
*There are Black Riders inside the Mountain!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD064subtitle]
*The Mouth of Sauron has found a way inside the Mountain!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD065subtitle]
*A Corsair looting party has been spotted to the south.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD066subtitle]
*The Haradrim have come to pillage Dale!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_Dwar011subtitle]
*By King Dáin's beard, the haradrim have brought their Mûmakil!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_Dwar012subtitle]
*The haradrim have brought their Oliphants!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_Dwar013subtitle]
*Cut the chatter, there's enemies to axe!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_Dwar014subtitle]
*Look at the size of that thing!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD067subtitle]
*More Haradrim Looters!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD068subtitle]
*We have a team working on a tunnel network underneath Dale.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD069subtitle]
*Soon we will be able to use the undermine power to send troops wherever they are needed.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD070subtitle]
*They're attacking our left flank!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD071subtitle]
*They're attacking our right flank!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD072subtitle]
*A small group of fighters have split off from the main group.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD073subtitle]
*More Corsair Looters!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD074subtitle]
*The Mordor host is approaching. The first wave will arrive soon. We must build up our defenses in Dale to keep them away from the Mountain.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD075subtitle]
*If the forces of Mordor breach the defenses in Dale, we must fall back to the Great Fortress in the mountain.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD076subtitle]
*We've spotted a small enemy force. They're trying to break into Erebor through a side tunnel.


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD077subtitle]
*They're trying to break in through the side!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD078subtitle]
*They're attacking the side gates!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGErebo_OffD079subtitle]
*Look there! The trolls! They're trying to get in through the side!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_OffE029subtitle]
*These forests are infested with Spiders - destroy all their lairs!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_OffE030subtitle]
*The dark powers of the Enemy are bolstered by these Signal Fires. Seize all of them!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_Elf1008subtitle]
*We have word from our Scouts. A great host of Mordor returns to defend the fortress!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_Elf1009subtitle]
*A forest fire has been ignited! Workers, extinguish the flames, lest our fortress be burned to ashes!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_OffE031subtitle]
*The Eye of the Dark Lord wanders wide... even in Mordor our designs cannot escape his thought! Ready our defenses, for the Enemy draws near!


[DIALOGEVENT:MGDolGu_OffE032subtitle]
*Ready our defenses! Reinforcements from Mordor will be arriving soon!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Mout017subtitle]
*So! Is this Celeborn and his elf-witch leading their people in their dramatic finale? How endearing! Kill them!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_Mout018subtitle]
*Ahhhh! The Elf-witch Galadriel and her foolish mate grace us with their presence - such exquisite pleasure their deaths shall bring!


[DIALOGEVENT:MELorie_OffG069subtitle]
*Move our forces across the river and cast down their beloved homes and trees!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEGreyH_Cors026subtitle]
*The Elves have been leaving Middle-earth by means of this port city they call the Grey Havens. Our presence in their harbor will be wholly unexpected. And once we destroy any sign of elves here, we will use this port to reinforce our invasion force into Eriador.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_OffG028subtitle]
*Tis the fabled Green Dragon Inn. Burn it to the ground!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_OffG029subtitle]
*The Green Dragon Inn is nothing but wreckage. Haha!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_Wild001subtitle]
*We come from Dunland to assist you, Goblin King.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_OffG030subtitle]
*The Hobbits of The Shire have caused our Dark Lord much trouble. Our domination of Eriador would not be complete without crushing this pocket of resistance.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_OffG031subtitle]
*The domination over Eriador would not be complete without us crushing The Shire. These Hobbit pests have caused much trouble for our Dark Lord Sauron.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_OffG032subtitle]
*Now listen up...the Hobbits' have four governing Seats of Power. Destroy these buildings, and we quell whatever hope they might have for reprisal.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEShire_OffG033subtitle]
*Let's get to it!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEForno_OffG017subtitle]
*The remaining Dunedain of this region have rallied the help of the Blue Mountain Dwarves. It is in this abandoned fortress of Fornost where they will see their last moments. Once our work is done, all of the lands West of the Misty Mountains will be ours!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEOldFo_OffM018subtitle]
*The northern parts of Mirkwood are the home of the Wood-elves. The first step in expelling them from their forest home is to seize the Old Forest Road. Once we control this road, we can dominate the rest of Mirkwood with ease.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEOldFo_OffM019subtitle]
*We must assemble an army and advance to the Old Forest Road.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEOldFo_OffM020subtitle]
*We can cross over to the north at the bridge along the river.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEOldFo_OffM021subtitle]
*Our scouts have found a way down into the river to the east.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEOldFo_OffM022subtitle]
*We need fire to burn those Ents to the ground!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEOldFo_OffM023subtitle]
*We can purchase Fire Arrows from the Tavern.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEOldFo_OffM024subtitle]
*We've found the Ent base! Burn every last Ent and Ent Moot to the ground!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEOldFo_OffM025subtitle]
*Find the Elven bases and destroy them to halt their defense of this road!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEOldFo_OffM026subtitle]
*The elves have all four towers up. Take them down quick or we shall lose the road!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_OffM033subtitle]
*We must earn favor with the dragons here. Destroy any Dwarf settlements you encounter.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_OffM034subtitle]
*The Dwarves are capturing the Dragons when they are still young. These Drakes can be very powerful. Free any Drakes that they have captured, and they will join us against the Dwarves!


[DIALOGEVENT:MEWithe_Mout025subtitle]
*We've freed the drakes, now we must find the dragon lord.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEErebo_OffM036subtitle]
*The mountain fortress of Erebor: The great pride of the Dwarves.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEErebo_OffM037subtitle]
*Before assaulting the mountain we must first conquer the city of Dale and pillage it of any resources we might find.


[DIALOGEVENT:MEErebo_OffM038subtitle]
*Shelob and the spiders of Mirkwood have been sent as scouts. They have great speed and an... appetite for destruction.


[DIALOGEVENT:MERiven_OffG025subtitle]
*This is it... The Elves last effort to withstand the onslaught of Sauron's power. The Mordor forces from the East shall be arriving soon. Crush the last haven for the Elves.


[DIALOGEVENT:MERiven_OffG026subtitle]
*Frodo, the free peoples last hope, lies dead.


[DIALOGEVENT:MERiven_OffG027subtitle]
*Now all what remains of these people have gathered here at the Elven city of Rivendell. As we begin the final siege, the Dark Lord makes his way west. Crush the last haven for the Elves.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT085subtitle]
*Select a Builder by left clicking on it.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT086subtitle]
*You'll notice that a menu appears on the right hand side of the screen. This menu will show all building options currently available.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT087subtitle]
*A quick way to select a Builder is by clicking on the Select Nearest Builder button next to the Palantir at the bottom of your screen.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrBas_OffT088subtitle]
*It seems as though you've built your structure away from the spotlight. To demolish a building, select it and click on the Demolish button in the Palantir.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT011subtitle]
*In order to do this, select multiple battalions and move your cursor over to the spotlight.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT039subtitle]
*To cast the power, right click on the ground.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT061subtitle]
*There's their main base. Those tunnels must be how they've been traveling through these mountains.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT062subtitle]
*One thing to note about their tunnels is that when destroyed, you must also destroy the rubble they leave behind. Otherwise the tunnels will spring forth once more and the Goblins will be able to use them yet again.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT063subtitle]
*If we completely destroy their tunnels and their fortress, that should put a stop to them infesting these mountains once and for all.


[DIALOGEVENT:MTrAdv_OffT064subtitle]
*Oh no! Goblins are pouring out from the tunnels, they must have seen us!

[SUBTITLE:CS11_02]
*Until now, this ancient city has been spared from the winds of war.


[SUBTITLE:CS12_01]
*Under siege from the Goblins of the Misty Mountains, Rivendell is no longer safe for the Elves.


[SUBTITLE:CS12_02]
*As time is now running out, Elrond forms a plan to unite the Elves and Dwarves of the North against Saurons advancing armies.


[SUBTITLE:CS12_03]
*His most powerful warrior, Glorfindel will join forces with the dwarf leader Gloin, to make war on the goblins and forge this alliance.


[SUBTITLE:CS15_01]
*The Dark Lord Sauron's influence spreads far across the lands of Middle-earth.


[SUBTITLE:CS15_02]
*Goblins descend from the Misty Mountains.


[SUBTITLE:CS15_03]
*A vast army flows from Dol Guldur, his evil fortress in Mirkwood.


[SUBTITLE:CS15_04]
*The War in the North begins in Lorien, where the host from Dol Guldur inteds to crush the elves wh long lived in the nearby enchated forest.


[SUBTITLE:CS16_01]
*The elves of Lorien have been driven from their enchanted forest.


[SUBTITLE:CS16_02]
*The tide of darkness from Dol Guldur will now spread to all of the Northern Lands.


[SUBTITLE:CS21_01]
*The Goblins have overtaken High Pass Road, blocking the vital connection between East and West.


[SUBTITLE:CS21_02]
*Here Glorfindel and Gloin now face their first challenge as they battle to retake the pass.


[SUBTITLE:CS22_01]
*With the Goblin army chased from High Pass, Elves can now travel to the lands beyond the Misty Mountains.


[SUBTITLE:CS22_02]
* The war against the Goblins continues.


[SUBTITLE:CS25_01]
*Sauron has infuence on all things untamed.


[SUBTITLE:CS25_02]
*The Goblins have been roused from their mountain caves and will fight for the Dark Lord.


[SUBTITLE:CS25_03]
*Even now their armies advance on the ancient elven port city of Mithlond.


[SUBTITLE:CS25_04]
*Sauron also sends the Corsairs of Umbar to attack from the sea.


[SUBTITLE:CS25_05]
*Once this port is destroyed, the elves will have no hope of scaping to the West.


[SUBTITLE:CS26_01]
*The remaining Elves have scattered into the hills.


[SUBTITLE:CS26_02]
*Cut them in peaces!


[SUBTITLE:CS26_03]
*Now the Goblins have an ancient debt to pay to the Hobbits of the nearby Shire.


[SUBTITLE:CS26_04]
*Kiiiillll!!!!


[SUBTITLE:CS31_01]
*Evil wells forth from an ancient fortress deep in the mountains, a foul place that has recently reawakened.


[SUBTITLE:CS31_02]
*The Goblins have a new leader who carries out Saurons tyrannical will.


[SUBTITLE:CS31_03]
*Once this sinister overlord is vanquished, the Goblins will be scattered and confused, loosening Sauron's grip on this region.


[SUBTITLE:CS32_01]
*In the battles aftermath, a lone dwarven prisoner is freed and desperately begs for Glorfindel and Gloins help.


[SUBTITLE:CS32_02]
*His Dwarven clan in the Blue Mountains is under attack from a terrible dragon.


[SUBTITLE:CS32_03]
*It is rumored that the dragon serves Sauron in exchange for one of the Dwarven Rings of Power, stolen from the Dwarves long ago.


[SUBTITLE:CS35_01]
*Long ago, a great Goblin Chief led an army into these lands known as the Shire.


[SUBTITLE:CS35_02]
*The defending hobbits killed the chief and routed the invaders.


[SUBTITLE:CS35_03]
*The Battle of Greenfields has not been forgotten by the Goblins and their kind.


[SUBTITLE:CS35_04]
*Now their leader returns to the land of the Hobbits, with a determination to triumph were their ancestors failed.


[SUBTITLE:CS35_05]
*The scourging of the Shire begins.


[SUBTITLE:CS35_06]
*Charge!


[SUBTITLE:CS36_01]
*The Goblin invasion appears to be unstoppable.


[SUBTITLE:CS36_02]
*You'll pay for this!


[SUBTITLE:CS36_03]
*Ya Bullies!


[SUBTITLE:CS36_04]
*Now Hobbits and Elves alike have been crushed and scattered throughout the lands.


[SUBTITLE:CS36_05]
*Oh no!!!


[SUBTITLE:CS41_01]
*After a long journey, the heroes arrive at the Blue Mountains.


[SUBTITLE:CS41_02]
*They find an army of Dwarves preparing for battle outside the entrance of a cave.


[SUBTITLE:CS41_03]
*The evil dragon has forced them from their home beneath the mountains, claiming their underground domain as his new lair.


[SUBTITLE:CS42_01]
*Saurons dragon has been defeated and the Dwarven ring reclaimed.


[SUBTITLE:CS42_02]
*However, Glorfindel and Gloin are in disbelief when their new allies refuse to join in the war against Sauron, choosing instead to return to mining the riches of their mountains.


[SUBTITLE:CS42_03]
*Disappointed, the heroes set out for the Elven port city of the Grey Havens hoping for a better reception from the Elves.


[SUBTITLE:CS42_04]
*But as they draw near the city, it is clear that all is not well there.


[SUBTITLE:CS45_01]
*Defend the fortress!


[SUBTITLE:CS45_02]
*Do not let them through!


[SUBTITLE:CS45_03]
*Dwarves and men are making a stand in the abandoned stronghold of Fornost.


[SUBTITLE:CS45_04]
*Hold steady dwarves!


[SUBTITLE:CS45_05]
*The Goblins seek to destroy the defenders and take this ancient fortress as a prize.


[SUBTITLE:CS46_01]
*The Goblins have cleared this region of the Sauron's enemies.


[SUBTITLE:CS46_02]
* Rivendell is near, but its destruction must wait, for now.


[SUBTITLE:CS46_03]
*We will infest this land!


[SUBTITLE:CS51_01]
*After thousands of years, Elves in Middle-earth have finally begun their exodus homeward across the sea.


[SUBTITLE:CS51_02]
*The port city of Mithlond, known as the Grey Havens, is where they converge to set forth westward.


[SUBTITLE:CS51_03]
*But now even this remote city isn't safe from Sauron.


[SUBTITLE:CS51_04]
*The Corsairs of Umbar from the South have choked off their naval passage westward and threaten to overrun the ancient port.


[SUBTITLE:CS52_01]
*The Dwarves of the Blue Mountains will fight along side the Free Peoples of Middle-earth after all.


[SUBTITLE:CS52_02]
*As this new alliance is celebrated, Arwen Evenstar arrives with the help of the Eagles.


[SUBTITLE:CS52_03]
*She brings the heroes troubled tidings from distant lands.


[SUBTITLE:CS52_04]
*Sauron's massive armies from Dol Guldur have moved north into Mirkwood, the domain of the Elven King Thranduil.


[SUBTITLE:CS52_05]
*The new allies must now rise up and prepare for the long journey eastward to aid their distant friends.


[SUBTITLE:CS52_06]
*Arwen urges the heroes to allow the eagles to take them directly to Thranduil's side for further counsel.


[SUBTITLE:CS55_01]
*As the Goblin hordes ravage the western lands, Sauron's forces from Dol Guldur spread North into Mirkwood.


[SUBTITLE:CS55_02]
*The Old Forest Road divides this great woodland and is key to the domination of the region.


[SUBTITLE:CS55_03]
*The Wood Elves of this forest, led by King Thranduil, have long protected this road.


[SUBTITLE:CS55_04]
*They will not give it up without a fight.


[SUBTITLE:CS56_01]
*The elves of Mirkwodd are now scattered and demoralised.


[SUBTITLE:CS56_02]
*The remaining few now retreat West to Rivendell.


[SUBTITLE:CS56_03]
*They're overrunning us!


[SUBTITLE:CS56_04]
*We cannot hold them!


[SUBTITLE:CS56_05]
*The time has come for Sauron to bring the war to the Dwarves.


[SUBTITLE:CS56_06]
*They are a proud people and will not easily surrender.


[SUBTITLE:CS61_01]
*While the heroes wing their way East, Saurons armies march north from Dol Guldur and arrive at a human settlement on the river Celduin.


[SUBTITLE:CS61_02]
*Dwarves from nearby Erebor, led by King Dáin, come to the aid of their human allies to the south.


[SUBTITLE:CS61_03]
*Before the battle ensues, Dáin sends a messenger to King Thranduil of the Wood Elves asking for their help.


[SUBTITLE:CS61_04]
*The Dwarves must fight a desperate battle while they await reinforcements from the Elves.


[SUBTITLE:CS62_01]
*The first wave of attackers is repelled but thousands more are approaching.


[SUBTITLE:CS62_02]
*The Dwarven messenger returns from Mirkwood with bleak news.


[SUBTITLE:CS62_03]
*There will be no help from the Elves as their lands are also in danger.


[SUBTITLE:CS62_04]
*King Dáin must fall back to the city of Dale and make his stand there.


[SUBTITLE:CS65_01]
*The Dragons of the Withered Heath are an ancient breed, and their hatred for the Dwarves burns bright even after a thousand years.


[SUBTITLE:CS65_02]
*Saurons leaders turn to them, seeking a possible ally in this brewing war against the Dwarves.


[SUBTITLE:CS66_01]
*The Mouth of Sauron enlists the Dragon Lord to help root the Dwarves out of Erebor and rid them of their king.


[SUBTITLE:CS66_02]
*The coveted mountain fortress itself will be given as a prize.


[SUBTITLE:CS66_03]
*The time has come for Dragons to fight for Sauron.


[SUBTITLE:CS71_01]
*The fate of Middle-earth hangs by a thread.


[SUBTITLE:CS71_02]
*The host from Dol Guldur marches relentlessly North towards Dale and Erebor.


[SUBTITLE:CS71_03]
*Saurons armies lay siege to Minas Tirith in the South.


[SUBTITLE:CS71_04]
*Frodo makes his way into Mordor.


[SUBTITLE:CS71_05]
*Glorfindel and Gloin arrive at Mirkwood to meet with King Thranduil of the Wood-Elves to further the alliance between Elf and Dwarf.


[SUBTITLE:CS71_06]
*Unaware of the council taking place in Mirkwood, King Dáin of the Dwarves grimly prepares for what may well be his final battle.


[SUBTITLE:CS71_07]
*Dwarves! This our last chance! Defend Erebor or die!!


[SUBTITLE:CS72_01]
*The arrival of the Elves from Mirkwood assures a victory for the Free Peoples.


[SUBTITLE:CS72_02]
*The siege of Erebor is broken.


[SUBTITLE:CS72_03]
*The shadow is lifting from Middle-earth.


[SUBTITLE:CS72_04]
*There is but one more task left: Lay bare the pits of Dol Guldur and drive the forces of darkness out of the Northern Lands.


[SUBTITLE:CS75_01]
*At last, the final battle against the Dwarves and the Men of Dale.


[SUBTITLE:CS75_02]
*If Sauron's forces are victorious here, then all of the lands East of the Misty Mountains will be under his rule.


[SUBTITLE:CS75_03]
*There will be no respite for the scattered forces of the North.


[SUBTITLE:CS76_01]
*Just as the Dwarves were long ago driven from the Mines of Moria, now they have been purged from their mountain home in Erebor.


[SUBTITLE:CS81_01]
*slay the Enemy to the last!


[SUBTITLE:CS81_02]
*The combined armies of Elf and Dwarf prepare to assault the evil fortress of Dol Guldur.


[SUBTITLE:CS81_03]
*The final battle of the War in the North is about to begin.


[SUBTITLE:CS82_01]
*With Saurons forces defeated, Galadriel at last throws down the walls of Dol Guldur.


[SUBTITLE:CS82_02]
*Peace has returned to Middle-earth.


[SUBTITLE:CS82_03]
*The War of the Ring is over.


[SUBTITLE:CS85_01]
*Rivendell is the crown jewel of the North.


[SUBTITLE:CS85_02]
*This sacred city is the last refuge for the Free Peoples of Middle-earth.


[SUBTITLE:CS85_03]
*Sauron has but one purpose now: To claim this ancient place for his own and extinguish all hope for the Free Peoples.


[SUBTITLE:CS86_01]
*Saurons reign over the Northern Lands is unopposed as the leaders of the Free People are no more.


[SUBTITLE:CS86_02]
*Darkness now falls upon all of Middle-earth.


[SUBTITLE:CS99_01]
*In the final years of the Third Age, Middle-earth stands on the brink of destruction.


[SUBTITLE:CS99_02]
*The Free Peoples are under threat from Sauron, the Lord of the Rings, who prepares his vast armies for war.


[SUBTITLE:CS99_03]
*At this late hour, the leaders of Elves, Dwarves, and Men come together at the Council of Elrond to decide their next move.


[SUBTITLE:CS99_04]
*After the Fellowship is assembled and heads south to destroy the source of Saurons power, the remaining leaders prepare for the Dark Lords assault upon the northern lands.


[SUBTITLE:CS99_05]
*The Elven and Dwarven races have always had little trust for each other, but now they must unite and fight a common enemy.

[SCRIPT:ANGAngmarVOText_02]
WITCH-KING: Troll of the North. What brings you to this place?


[SCRIPT:ANGAngmarVOText_03]
ROGASH: Come to kill iron faced Men, who live in old ruins to north, keep Trolls fighting Trolls.\nRogash bring Trolls together, take gold and meat from Men in green lands.


[SCRIPT:ANGAngmarVOText_04]

[SCRIPT:ANGAngmarHintText_06]
Look! A den of Hill Trolls is under attack! It might be useful - don't let it fall!

We've taken the Mill for ourselves! It will grind out more resources for us to use.

[SCRIPT:ANGBarrowDownsIntroText_021]
ANGMAR OFFICER: We cannot bring our entire host at once, or the Prince may lose his nerve.\nMore troops will arrive during the battle to help you hold the royal barrow.

We have cleared out the Rangers who guarded the barrows. They will not nip at our reinforcements' heels now.


[SCRIPT:ANGBarrowDownsHintText_01]
Rangers of Arnor lurk amongst the barrows, on guard against those who would plunder or desecrate their 'hallowed' ground. They will disrupt our reinforcements if we do not slay them!

Now our forces must hold the royal barrow against all attempts to retake it.


[SCRIPT:ANGBarrowDownsHintText_03]
Morgomir has arrived with reinforcements to help hold the royal barrow!


[SCRIPT:ANGBarrowDownsHintText_04]
More of the Witch-king's servants have arrived, and thirst for battle.

The Witch-king's plan has worked - we have goaded the Prince into attacking! Kill him and Cardolan is finished!


[SCRIPT:ANGBarrowDownsHintText_06]
WITCH-KING: I have come. Let the fools of Cardolan join their fallen fathers.


[SCRIPT:ANGBarrowDownsHintText_07]
If we lose the royal barrow for too long, Cardolan's pride will be satisfied and they will refuse to risk all. We cannot allow that!

We no longer have forces on the royal barrow! We must retake it soon, or all is lost!


[SCRIPT:ANGBarrowDownsHintText_09]
We have retaken the royal barrow. Hold it against further attacks!

[SUBTITLE:BABME_01]
The trail of blood and suffering is over -- Angmar is defeated.


[SUBTITLE:BABME_02]
Like so many cities of Arnor, it lies in ruin, its hopes for a final conquest of the West, gone. Middle Earth rejoiced


[SUBTITLE:BABME_03]
In his final stand, the Witch-king sat upon his black horse before us.


[SUBTITLE:BABME_04]
As we rode forward, he realized that all hope was lost.


[SUBTITLE:BABME_05]
His terrifying scream of rage sent the chill of winter down our spines, as he turned and fled into the shadows.


[SUBTITLE:BABME_06]
Earnur struck out to chase him down, But I then realized his power.


[SUBTITLE:BABME_07]
We thought him but a powerful Black Númenorean, but he is Nazgûl, First of the Nine, most fell servant of the Dark Lord Sauron.


[SUBTITLE:BABME_08]
I put up my hand, and called out to Earnur: 'Do not pursue him! He will not return to these lands'.


[SUBTITLE:BABME_09]
'Far off yet is his doom, and not by the hand of man shall he fall.


[SUBTITLE:BABMO_01]
After the Witch-kings bloody, final triumph over Arnor, the kingdom of Gondor can look away no more,


[SUBTITLE:BABMO_02]
lest the Iron Crown dominate all the lands of the West. Elves and Men come together to drive Evil from the north forever.


[SUBTITLE:BABMO_03]
Earnur of Gondor would lead the Men. The Elves call for Glorfindel, Elf-lord of Rivendell and Gondolin, to lead them.


[SUBTITLE:BABMO_04]
And so it is, at the will of my people, that I change  from storyteller to blade-bearer once more.


[SUBTITLE:BABMO_05]
I ride, Elrond at my side, under Earnurs banner. Elves and Men together will drive evil from the North forever.


[SUBTITLE:BABMO_06]
We will not merely push the Witch-king back to his lair of Carn Dûm as we had foolishly done before.


[SUBTITLE:BABMO_07]
We intend the total destruction of Angmar; and this time, it will be so.


[SUBTITLE:BACO_01]
Middle-earth enjoyed a thousand years of peace after the Ring was lost and the death of Isildur


[SUBTITLE:BACO_010]
and Arthedain, the most powerful of the Northern realms,


[SUBTITLE:BACO_011]
still ruled by Isildurs heirs from the capital of Fornost.


[SUBTITLE:BACO_012]
It was during the reign of the eighth King of Arthedain that evil began to multiply in Angmar,


[SUBTITLE:BACO_013]
a twisted, frozen land that lay North beyond the Ettenmoors, and home of the Black Númenoreans.


[SUBTITLE:BACO_014]
Among them a sorcerer of great power arose, known only as the Witch-king...


[SUBTITLE:BACO_015]
He has taken up his Iron Crown for a single purpose:


[SUBTITLE:BACO_016]
to destroy the Dúnedain and their kingdom of Arnor 


[SUBTITLE:BACO_02]
but Sauron was not dead, only cast to the shadows.


[SUBTITLE:BACO_03]
 In time, evil once more began to move


[SUBTITLE:BACO_04]
Arnor: The North Kingdom of Men, ruled by the heirs of Isildur.


[SUBTITLE:BACO_05]
This land of passion and promise is waylaid by mens inability to set aside petty differences;


[SUBTITLE:BACO_06]
and so it was that civil strife weakened the Dúnedain and broke the land into three realms:


[SUBTITLE:BACO_07]
Rhudaur, the smallest and weakest of the Dúnedain kingships


[SUBTITLE:BACO_08]
Cardolan, guardian of the ancient Barrow Downs,


[SUBTITLE:BACO_09]
where the forefathers of the Dúnedain lay entombed 


[SUBTITLE:BAM1E_01]
Now all of Angmar is united under the Iron Crown. Legions of orcs fight under the command of the Thrall Masters of Angmar.


[SUBTITLE:BAM1E_02]
The great fortress at Carn Dum continues to rise, it will make an ideal sanctum for the Witch-king to work his fell sorcery.


[SUBTITLE:BAM1E_03]
The hammer is forged at last, ready to smite the heirs of Elendil and lay their kingdoms low.


[SUBTITLE:BAM1O_01]
Before Arnor can be invaded, the Witch-king needs a symbol to unite Angmars proud and willful denizens.


[SUBTITLE:BAM1O_02]
Legends say that here in ages past loomed a great fortress of the ancient darkness, 


[SUBTITLE:BAM1O_03]
its ruins dark and silent in the mountains.


[SUBTITLE:BAM1O_04]
Rebuilding this bastion will secure the Iron Crowns dominion over the Black Numenoreans and the northern troll tribes...


[SUBTITLE:BAM30_03]
They are led by Hwaldar, a Hillchief in secret league with Angmar.


[SUBTITLE:BAM30_04]
Moving to crush this resistance, Argeleb has Hwaldar seized, and moves into Rhudaur.


[SUBTITLE:BAM30_07]
and he will seize it with both hands.


[SUBTITLE:BAM3E_01]
King Argeleb is slain,


[SUBTITLE:BAM3E_02]
his hope for a unified North Kingdom shattered with his pride in the ruins of Rhudaur.


[SUBTITLE:BAM3E_03]
Hwaldar takes his place as a leading commander serving the Iron Crown,


[SUBTITLE:BAM3E_04]
while his people provide more minions for the Thrall Masters.


[SUBTITLE:BAM3E_05]
But despite their wounds, the Dúnedain are not without power.


[SUBTITLE:BAM3E_06]
The fortified Weather Hills and fortress at Amon Sûl stand as a shield protecting Fornost and the heart of Arnor


[SUBTITLE:BAM3O_01]
In the face of this gathering storm, King Argeleb of Arthedain reclaims the throne of all Arnor.


[SUBTITLE:BAM3O_02]
Cardolan does not oppose him, but one faction of the Hillmen of Rhudaur begin to rebel.


[SUBTITLE:BAM3O_05]
But Angmar, its power ready, advances into the weakest of the Dúnedain realms.


[SUBTITLE:BAM3O_06]
Thus one mans lust for power has given the Witch-king an opportunity


[SUBTITLE:BAM4E_01]
Amon Sûl is laid to ruin.


[SUBTITLE:BAM4E_02]
With its garrison reduced, the great bastion of the north could not withstand Angmars rage.


[SUBTITLE:BAM4E_03]
But Angmars victory is not complete;


[SUBTITLE:BAM4E_04]
Arveleg  has escaped Amon Sûl with a prize that the Witch-king covets over all others


[SUBTITLE:BAM4O_01]
The new king, Arveleg son of Argeleb, with the help of Cardolan and the Elves, has checked Angmars advance;


[SUBTITLE:BAM4O_02]
 for many years they have held a frontier along the Weather Hills.


[SUBTITLE:BAM4O_03]
Using the power of the Palantir of Amon Sûl, Arveleg has foiled every attack and stratagem.


[SUBTITLE:BAM4O_04]
The Witch-king must now undertake a daring and dangerous strategy: a direct assault on the fortress of Amon Sûl.


[SUBTITLE:BAM4O_05]
Diversionary attacks draw off the forces of Cardolan and the Elves, while the main army strikes the fortress.


[SUBTITLE:BAM4O_06]
Although not the largest bastions in Middle-Earth, Amon Sûl is host to a mighty power  the master Palantir of the North.


[SUBTITLE:BAM5E_01]
The shards of the Palantir still contain great power.


[SUBTITLE:BAM5E_02]
For many centuries the Black Númenoreans have dabbled in the dark arts.


[SUBTITLE:BAM5E_03]
Now these sorcerers have a focus to enhance and concentrate their power, unleashing a new terror upon Arnor.


[SUBTITLE:BAM5O_01]
The fall of Amon Sûl is a terrible blow to the will of the Dúnedain.


[SUBTITLE:BAM5O_02]
However, a brave band led by Arveleg has fled the fortress with the Palantir, heading back toward Fornost.


[SUBTITLE:BAM5O_03]
Angered by its escape, the Witch-king dispatches the Lieutenant of Carn Dûm with orders to retrieve the stolen orb.


[SUBTITLE:BAM60_06]
The Witch-king orders his proven lieutenants, Hwaldar and Rogash, to seize the most sacred ground in Arnor, the Barrow Downs.


[SUBTITLE:BAM6E_01]
Everywhere the armies of Angmar march, death and desolation follow.


[SUBTITLE:BAM6E_02]
Cardolan has fallen, and all that remains is the realm of Arthedain. Men have allowed this to happen


[SUBTITLE:BAM6E_03]
Their indecision and disunity have brought them to the brink of annihilation


[SUBTITLE:BAM6O_01]
The destruction of Amon Sûl and its palantir crippled the Army of Arthedain, but Fornost still stands.


[SUBTITLE:BAM6O_02]
The army and the people are prepared to defend the city to the bitter end.


[SUBTITLE:BAM6O_03]
But the Witch-king cannot commit his army to a siege at Fornost with an enemy free to attack his rear.


[SUBTITLE:BAM6O_04]
For the army of Cardolan was not at Amon Sûl, and is still in the field.


[SUBTITLE:BAM6O_05]
A way must be devised to make them fight on ground of the Witch-kings choosing.


[SUBTITLE:BAM6O_07]
With the hallowed graves of their ancestors and kings at risk, Cardolan will be forced to battle.


[SUBTITLE:BAM6O_08]
On these grounds Angmar can bleed them white, clearing the path for final victory.


[SUBTITLE:BAM7E_01]
The Witch-kings cunning matches his cruelty.


[SUBTITLE:BAM7E_02]
The well-timed arrival of his lieutenants prevented a complete annihilation of his army.


[SUBTITLE:BAM7E_03]
The Iron Crown has suffered a heavy blow, but Angmar has not been defeated 


[SUBTITLE:BAM7E_04]
It will take time to recover its strength Perhaps enough time for Arnor to rise anew.


[SUBTITLE:BAM7E_05]
But the Witch-king has no intention of allowing this to happen


[SUBTITLE:BAM7O_01]
Arnor sits at the edge of the abyss. Rhudaur is the Witch-kings, Cardolan is reduced to scattered bands of refugees.


[SUBTITLE:BAM7O_02]
Only Fornost stands between Angmar and total domination of the North.


[SUBTITLE:BAM7O_03]
Or so it appeared. The attack on Rivendell has united the Elven strongholds.


[SUBTITLE:BAM7O_04]
Now, the Elves of Lindon, Rivendell and even Lórien march against Angmar.


[SUBTITLE:BAM7O_05]
They are intent to drive a sword into the heart of Angmar that would last an age 


[SUBTITLE:BAM8E_01]
Though he fought with a valor rarely seen among men, the young Arnorian captain paid a price beyond death, and now serves the Iron Crown.


[SUBTITLE:BAM8E_02]
Angmars great plague stretched far and wide, striking at the heart of Arnor and weakening the already fragile Dúnedain defenses.


[SUBTITLE:BAM8E_03]
But the Witch-king will not be satisfied until Arnor lay buried in the bodies and blood of its youth.


[SUBTITLE:BAM8O_01]
The Dunedain of Arnor believe the Elven strike will provide them a chance to recover.


[SUBTITLE:BAM8O_02]
Given time, Arnor can finish what the elves had started.


[SUBTITLE:BAM8O_03]
But they reckon without knowledge of the depth of the Witch-kings hatred


[SUBTITLE:BAM8O_04]
He sends his sorcerers among the barrows of the great Arnor kings.


[SUBTITLE:BAM8O_05]
While the desecration of this hallowed soil might break the hearts of men, the Witch-king has an even darker purpose:


[SUBTITLE:BAM8O_06]
to unleash a malevolent plague across the lands of men and elves.


[SUBTITLE:BAM9E_01]
Angmars hammer fell, and down came Fornost, in ash and fire!


[SUBTITLE:BAM9E_02]
Arnor never wakes from its age-long nightmare; thousands lay dead in the streets.


[SUBTITLE:BAM9E_03]
The Witch-kings malice can now spread throughout these Northern Lands.


[SUBTITLE:BAM9E_04]
Evil had come to Arnor and evil prevailed.


[SUBTITLE:BAM9O_01]
Many years have passed since the great plague devastated the North.


[SUBTITLE:BAM9O_02]
In great secrecy the hosts of Angmar have been reforged, and the final stroke is ready to fall upon the last bastion of Arnors power: Fornost.


[SUBTITLE:BAM9O_03]
With its beautiful spires and unyielding walls, it alone stands between the Witch-king and total victory.


[SUBTITLE:BAM9O_04]
But the Dunedain will not fall easily.


[SUBTITLE:BAM9O_05]
They have gathered all of their host and all of their allies for this battle.


[SUBTITLE:BAM9O_06]
The last and decisive battle for the North is about to begin....


[SUBTITLE:CAC10_01]
The sharp spires of Mount Gundabad house several loosely allied tribes of orcs,


[SUBTITLE:CAC10_02]
who dominate the scattered snow troll and goblin clans.


[SUBTITLE:CAC10_03]
In order for the Witch-king to defeat the realms of Arnor, he needs the blood and iron of Gundabad.


[SUBTITLE:CAC11_01]
But Angmar needs sword arms, not corpses.


[SUBTITLE:CAC11_02]
Therefore, he will win by guile that which force would destroy.


[SUBTITLE:CAC12_01]
A blade in the dark forces a gathering of the tribes to compete for the crown


[SUBTITLE:CAC13_01]
To this gathering, the Witch-king sends his most fearsome lieutenant, Rogash, Troll of the North,


[SUBTITLE:CAC13_02]
to ensure that the orcs of Gundabad will heed the orders of the Iron Crown


[SUBTITLE:CAC14_01]
 Through the power and savagery of Rogash, Mount Gundabad has yielded.


[SUBTITLE:CAC14_02]
Now, legions of orcs fight under the command of the Thrall Masters of Angmar.


[SUBTITLE:CAC14_03]
The hammer is forged at last, ready to smite the heirs of Elendil and lay their kingdoms low

In T.A. 2989. Óin and a company of Dwarves lay siege to the Dimrill Dale ...


[SCRIPT:1Newintro1]

[SCRIPT:1Newintro2]

Relics Found:


[SCRIPT:RELICFOUND1]
There in the rubble, a truesilver helmet was found!


[SCRIPT:RELICFOUND2]
Within these barrels of weapons, the mighty axe of Durin was found!


[SCRIPT:1OBJREMINDERVET]
All Heroes must survive the reclamation of the Dwarrowdelf, or all will be lost.


[SCRIPT:SAVEPLYR]
We recommend saving often to avoid losing progress during this long mission which contains several acts and cinematic sequences. You may experience memory crashes due to its length.


[SCRIPT:1nNOACCESS]
We must first clear the rest of the enemy forces from the dale before we aid Óin, or our flank will be unprotected!


[SCRIPT:1nACCESS]
An opening in the skirmish, aid Óin before he is overwhelmed!


[SCRIPT:1nOINRESCUE]
Óin: Come on cousin! Let us remove this fiend from the Gate of Durin!


[SCRIPT:1BALININTROEND]
Balin: That should be the last of them! The Dimrill Gate has been reclaimed! This is but the first of many victories that await us.


[SCRIPT:1INTROVER1]
Balin has reclaimed the Dimrill Gate for Erebor! But his story has just begun ...


[SCRIPT:1INTROVER2]
... Into the black pit of Moria we must go to rekindle the great braziers of our folk, and reclaim what was lost.


[SCRIPT:1ACT2OIN1]
Óin: We have secured the First Hall! Now we will take back our ancient Kingdom and slay the foul enemy within!


[SCRIPT:1MORIADIAL2]
Balin: Stay alert. These dark halls might be home to more than just orcs...


[SCRIPT:1MORIADIAL3]
Óin: Let's settle down here for now and gather strength. We will send word to Dáin once we have secured a point of defence.


[SCRIPT:1MORIADIAL4]
Balin: The gate is locked tight. We must find a Key to open it and continue onwards.


[SCRIPT:1MORIAKEY1]
Balin: The Chamber of Records is locked. There should be a key to enter within.


[SCRIPT:1MORIACHAMBERUNSURE]
Óin: The Chamber smells foul, there must be goblins inside.


[SCRIPT:1MORIAKEY2]
Balin: This key does not fit the keyhole of this gate. We must find another.


[SCRIPT:1MORIADIAL5]
Balin: Keep your blades to hand! \n Do you hear it?


[SCRIPT:1MORIADIAL6]
Balin: Goblins! They mean to ambush us!


[SCRIPT:1MORIADIAL7]
Dwarf: By my dear mother's beard! \n What do we do!?


[SCRIPT:1MORIADIAL8]
Balin: Steady! We will not be driven out so easily!


[SCRIPT:1MORIADIAL9]
Balin: Drums! If it is to be war, then let us be ferocious! Teach them who the true masters of these hills are!


[SCRIPT:1MORIADIAL10]
Dwarf: That will teach them! None may stand before the Longbeards of Erebor, the Heirs of Oakenshield!


[SCRIPT:1MORIAMINESDIAL2]
Dwarf: Whatever lurks beneath these waters, we must keep going!


[SCRIPT:1MORIAMINESE2DIAL0]
Óin: We cannot go on much further, cousin. Many are wounded. \n We must etablish a foothold now, so that in time we may venture further.


[SCRIPT:1MORIAMINESE2DIAL1]
Balin: Agreed. We will fortify ourselves within the Twenty-first Hall. You, Óin, are in charge of treating the wounded. \n Send word to King Dáin. He will be expecting a report.


[SCRIPT:1MORIAMINESE2DIAL2]
Colony: All hail Balin, son of Fundin! Lord of Khazad-dûm! \n Hurrah! Hurrah for Balin!


[SCRIPT:1PART3INTRO1]
Soon afterwards The Dwarves recovered their strength and settled the Twenty-first Hall. \n Balin mustered his kin to begin clear out the western mines and halls of the vile orcish usurpers ...


[SCRIPT:1PART3INTRO2]
Many wondrous artifacts were recovered. The Dwarves of Balin's Colony donned the armor of their forebears, hard and tough like a dragon's hide. \n Scores of orcs were killed, cut down relentlessly by the fury of the Dwarves ...


[SCRIPT:1PART3INTRO3]
Balin's Colony grew. The Dwarves began to venture deep within their ancient halls, driving the orcs before them wherever they were found... \n Until at last they reached the West-gate, known as the Doors of Durin ...


[SCRIPT:1PART3INTRO4]
The Lord of Moria discovered ancient treasures: Durin's Axe, and a truesilver helmet of untold age ...


[SCRIPT:1PART3INTRO5]
Every find was catalogued in the Book of Mazarbul. For five years they fought and ventured, slowly gaining ground... \n Until, during the fifth year, their luck had run out.


[SCRIPT:1PART3INTRO6]
Lord Balin wrote a stack of letters, to be sent to Longbeard strongholds across Middle-earth:\n Khazad-dûm had been reclaimed, and would remain secure if more settlers were to arrive.


[SCRIPT:1PART3INTROEND]
Ere he sent out this request, Balin traveled to the Mirrormere to quietly reflect upon his quest.


[SCRIPT:BALINMIRRORMERE]
Balin: Ah ... the sun still shines in gold and silver upon the stones of the Dimrill Dale, as it did in the days of Durin...


[SCRIPT:1THEFALL0]
He looked into the waters, saw Durin's Crown above ... \n And then he saw no more.


[SCRIPT:1THEFALL01]
A lone goblin scout killed Balin with a single arrow. Balin, son of Fundin, was slain.


[SCRIPT:1THEFALL02]
Nothing could be done. \n 'Leaderless!', the goblin scout reported. 'The Dwarves are leaderless!'


[SCRIPT:1THEFALL03]
Soon an army of orcs appeared at the Dimrill Gate. There were many Trolls amongst their numbers. The assault upon Balin's Colony soon began ...


[SCRIPT:1THEFALL04]
The Dwarves, armed with steel and furious grief, resolved to avenge their lord \n Each Dwarf fought with the strength of three, and stopped the orcs in their tracks. But the orcs kept coming ...


[SCRIPT:1THEFALL05]
The orcish horde breached the barricade and stormed the First Hall. Many Dwarves lay dead in their wake. \n Balin's corpse was recovered, and was set into a tomb in the Chamber of Mazarbul.


[SCRIPT:1OINFALLBE1]
Dwarf Officer: Óin, you have arrived in time! \n They have breached our defences! They are coming for us in great number!


[SCRIPT:1OINFALLBE2]
Óin: This colony must not be lost! Khazâd ai-mênu!


[SCRIPT:1OINFALLBE3]
Óin: We cannot hold them here! \n Fall back to the Chamber of Mazarbul!


[SCRIPT:1OINFALLBE4]
Ori: We will fortify the Chamber of Mazarbul and wait. Go swiftly Lord Óin!


[SCRIPT:BALROGNOTICE]
Dwarf: It is Durin's Bane! It comes for us! Flee for your lives!


[SCRIPT:1OINFALLOBJ1]
Escape to the Chamber of Mazarbul


[SCRIPT:1OINFALLDE1]
Óin: The water... it has risen high in our absence...


[SCRIPT:1OINFALLDE2]
Dwarf Officer: Óin! There is movement in the water! Watch out!


[SCRIPT:1OINFALLDE3]
Óin: Grasping arms! Death lies inside the waters! We cannot flee! We must slay this beast and find a way forward!


[SCRIPT:1OINFALLDE4]
Dwarf: No! It has slain Óin! we must flee back to the Chamber of Mazarbul! The end of days is upon us!


[SCRIPT:1ORICHAMBERFAL2]
Dwarf: My lord Ori, the hammer of our doom has struck! Óin is dead!


[SCRIPT:THEENDCREDITS]
In T.A. 2994, Balin's Colony was destroyed. No word reached Dáin Ironfoot.\n It would be yet another 30 years before the Company of the Ring passed through and discovered their fate...
